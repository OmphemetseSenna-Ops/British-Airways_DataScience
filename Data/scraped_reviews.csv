1.0,Bart Johnson,United States,2025-01-05,Not the best customer service,"✅ Trip Verified |   Not the best customer service. Requested wheelchair service and did not get it on the first leg. Had to fight for it on the second leg. The seat wasn’t the most comfortable. On the airbus, there are air vents for individual seats. When we first got on the plane, it was very hot. In Monrovia, the ticket service was horrible. We stood in one line and was told we had to stand in another because of the wheelchair service. And the lines were long. An item may have been left on the plane and we cannot get in touch with anybody to inquire about lost and found. The operator on the phone barely understood what I was saying language barrier. She gave me a number for the DC location. No one answered the phone and unable to leave a message. It’s amazing to me how bad the customer service is",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Monrovia  to Washington via Addas Ababa,2025-01-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2,no
2.0,H Thornton,United States,2025-01-03,Worst business class experience,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst business class experience you can possibly imagine. 1) Security riot before gate 19 made us almost late for our flight. No special security entrance for business class customers in Ethiopian Airlines home airport. It was a disaster. People getting crushed, children crying, Elderly getting trampled. 2) Flight left late at Addis and also Rome making us miss our connection flight in Toronto. No help. 3) Same gluten free meal for each leg of the flight and it was awful. 4) Baby crying in business class for 15 hours. Staff did nothing. I paid for an upgraded seat to be kept awake the whole flight.",Business,Business Class,Addis Ababa to Toronto via Rome,2025-01-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3,no
3.0,I Lee,United States,2024-12-17,the toilets became dirty,"✅ Trip Verified |   Towards the end of the flight, the toilets became dirty and unhygienic.  During the pre-landing phase, I was awoken by a flight attendant unbuckling my seatbelt and removing my blanket. Such behavior is highly unprofessional. After landing in Nairobi and before the passengers started to disembark, the aircraft's power shut down. This resulted in a lack of ventilation and air conditioning for nearly 20 minutes.",Business,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Nairobi,2024-12-01,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,3,no
1.0,Brenda Acan,United States,2024-12-16,Worst service ever,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Beside delaying our flight for 12hours, our baggage got delayed and no one bothers to answer follow up calls. Our whole holiday was ruined because of Ethiopian Airlines poor service, imagine reaching on holiday with no clothes and basic personal needs. We missed out on a whole day of paid planned activities and hotel booking. I hope never to use this airline again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Zanzibar via Ethiopia,2024-12-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
3.0,Jillian Saltpaw,United States,2024-12-15,service fell painfully short,"✅ Trip Verified |   My recent journey from Washington Dulles (IAD) to Addis Ababa (ADD) on Ethiopian Airlines left much to be desired. Despite the promise of smooth air travel, the service fell painfully short at every stage. Boarding Chaos: The boarding process was an unorganized disaster, dragging on for nearly an hour. No communication, no clear instructions—just utter confusion that could’ve easily been avoided with better planning and staff coordination. Clueless Cabin Crew: Once onboard, I was met with shocking unhelpfulness. A steward noticed there was no room for my bags but simply stared blankly, offering no solution or assistance. I had to figure out on my own to place them under the seat in front of me. The crew’s inability (or unwillingness) to provide basic support was insulting. Unprofessional Behavior: The icing on the cake? A steward reached over my husband—without so much as a word—to grab a duty-free magazine. Not only did she fail to excuse herself, but she didn’t even bother to return the magazine afterward. This lack of courtesy and respect is completely unacceptable on an international flight. Overall, the disorganization, lack of professionalism, and dismissive attitude of the cabin crew made for a truly frustrating experience. Ethiopian Airlines needs to seriously rethink their training and customer service standards. Travelers deserve better.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington IAD to Johannesburg,2024-12-01,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1,no
1.0,E Basano,United States,2024-12-04,Ethiopian Airlines needs to do better,"✅ Trip Verified |   I just landed from an Ethiopian airline ET516 from Lome to IAD. This was an 11 hr flight. Shortly after takeoff, the TV entertainment stopped working in my row of 3 seats. I glanced at a few other monitors and all seemed to be in my state. The tv screens didn’t respond to button presses or screen touch. This means, for the 11 hours, there was no entertainment. The button for overhead light also stopped working.  For long swatches of time, the cabin was pitch black. I guess this was by design. Needless to say this experience was a nightmare. Ethiopian Airlines needs to do better.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Washington via Lome,2024-11-01,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no
4.0,M Larsen,United States,2024-12-01,I felt like I was back in the 90's,"✅ Trip Verified | HKG-BKK-ADD-LAD-ADD-VIE-CPH Ethiopian is not the worst airline I've ever flown, but it's definitely not very good. Cabin crew fluctuated between friendly and helpful, to unenthusiastic with a feeling that they had given up making an effort a long time ago. Most of the planes I flew were old. With touch screens that didn't work, and with a joystick where you press the buttons to control a mouse cursor that sloooowly moves across the screen. I felt like I was back in the 90's. The wifi did not work on roughly 75% of the flights I was on. When it did, the speeds were quite good. Toilets were, on some of the flights, disgusting. They were definitely not cleaned or refreshed regularly, and smelled really bad. On other flights they were okay. On the ADD-VIE-CPH leg the plane was a dreamliner, with more modern seats and screens. However, the inflight entertainment system was riddled with bugs. No movies would play without buffering and stuttering, making it impossible to watch for more than 10 seconds. Many screens were stuck in a neverending reboot sequence, even though the crew kept trying to reset them. On top of that, every time there was a crew announcement, the movie selection screen would reset, forcing you to scroll the list of movies all over again. Not that it mattered, as no movies were watchable due to the skipping and stuttering. On this leg, we were served a pasta salad with shrimp. I found a hair in my food, and made the cabin crew aware of this. They responded by offering me a new set of cutlery. When I asked for another pasta salad, the one I received had exactly one shrimp in it. I had the clear feeling that hair in the food would not be reported anywhere. There was no apology from the crew either. I was put on this itinerary by work, but I would never chose Ethiopian airlines for my own money.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Copenhagen via Luanda,2024-11-01,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3,no
1.0,S Jiang,United States,2024-12-01,expected much more,"✅ Trip Verified |   Service was not there at all. Flight was delayed due to inbound flight arriving late which is understandable. But they took way too long to turnover and clean with no instructions or explanation on ground. Everyone was just waiting with no idea how long to wait. When we boarding, flight attendant sounded annoyed, pointing to which aisle. We got seated and saw a more senior flight attendant sitting till take off. After take off she didn’t do much as well. Safety demonstration was a short video. Crew didn’t bother checking and making sure I was secured. Aircraft was in a relatively poor condition. Bottom of the toilet door was already falling apart, 3 charging ports between us not working, leaning back function of my seat was rough, difficult to get it moving. Even a smoking sign is inverted. Table was dirty and we were seated first row with flight attendant not even asking if we wanted the entertainment. Flight attendant provided close to no service at all. Food was ok, just weird. Flight attendant came over and asked chicken or beef without telling us what was each. So we took a beef and a chicken. What’s funny was the beef was actually lamb. Meat was still ok. But the rice for the beef was hard. The other bread, biscuits, butter and cheese were the usual packaged stuff. Pasta salad tasted weird and chocolate cake was sweet.  Towards the end of our flight, flight attendant were busy packing stuff. They even poured juices into the toilet. Prior to landing, flight attendant didn’t do landing checks to make sure things were secured. When we left, no goodbyes or a smile. Honestly expected much more from a full fledge and Africa best airline. Only compliment was the Singaporean stuff in Tokyo. Extremely friendly, polite and helpful.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to Seoul,2024-12-01,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,1,no
1.0,Gala Pate,United States,2024-11-29,the most uncomfortable flight,Not Verified | It was the most uncomfortable flight and the service was terrible. We barely recieved a greeting when boarding. The in-flight device was sub-par and no wi-fi. We had a roundtrip from Atlanta to Lusaka and during my stay I had a death in my immediate family and had to change my departure date to attend the funeral. We went to Ethiopian Airlines office in Lusaka and they were very cold and lacked customer service. We waited for hours to speak with someone and it felt like they were deliberately ignoring us. After hours of waiting they asked for a death certificate and mind you thats not produced on the same day a person passes away. We returned at a later date with documentation and they refused to change my departure date and they informed me a change in date was impossible and if I missed my flight I would have to pay for a new ticket at full price so I ended up paying for another ticket at full price to stay for bereavement. Ethiopian staff were not empathetic and did not take into consideration that my initial ticket was already expense. On the flights the flight crew spoke in their native language and ignored everyone that did not speak their language. It was obvious they were not happy to service the passengers and only smiled when they spoke with their fellow Ethiopians.,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta GA to Lusaka Zambia via Addis Ababa,2023-12-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
4.0,R Adamski,United States,2024-11-01,didn’t like the flight or the service,"✅ Trip Verified | The staff had a rather average attitude. They were not amiable at all and seemed too busy to be attentive. I did not like their approach, and I did not feel special. The food was good, but the internet didn’t work. A flight attendant gave me another passenger’s login, but it still didn’t work. After landing, the flight attendants didn’t say goodbye to us and weren’t present at the doors. In general, I didn’t like the flight or the service.",Business,Business Class,Hong Kong to Bangkok,2024-08-01,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3,no
1.0,Amadu Seidu,United States,2024-10-27,appalling customer service experience,"Not Verified | Stranded, Ignored, and Betrayed: Ethiopian Airlines’ Customer Service Nightmare, Why This Airline Is the Last Choice You Should Make for Your Holiday Travel. Imagine standing at an airport, anxiously awaiting a call from a loved one who is finally coming home—suddenly, your phone rings—they are panicked, telling you they have been denied boarding. No explanation. No warning. Nothing. This happened to my elderly mother, a woman in her 80s with limited mobility, who Ethiopian Airlines inexplicably refused to board her long-awaited flight from Accra to Atlanta on August 17, 2024. A nightmare followed: an appalling customer service experience that left her stranded in Ghana while the airline ignored our pleas. If you are considering Ethiopian Airlines, especially for the holiday season, heed this warning: their customer service ranks among the worst in the industry. They operate with no accountability, no empathy, and no respect for the people who trust them. The Shocking Refusal: Abandoning an Elderly Passenger My mother had been planning her visit to the U.S. for months. We booked her Ethiopian Airlines flight, code CFNFQS, scheduled for August 17th, and even arranged for their “Meet and Assist” service, designed to offer wheelchair assistance and attentive care for elderly passengers. Every detail was prepared, every arrangement secured—or so we thought. But when she arrived at Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ethiopian Airlines’ supervisor, (Edward A. Parker), blocked her from boarding. His vague reasoning? “Medical reasons”. However, he never explained further, nor did he provide any documentation or reach out to the family member who booked her ticket. The airline’s silence was chilling. Ethiopian Airlines had both my contact information and the option to explain why a paying, elderly customer with limited mobility was suddenly unfit to board. Yet they did nothing. No call, no email, no apology. Their complete disregard for my mother’s distress in Ghana went beyond poor customer service. It was inhumane. Desperate for Answers: Two Months of Silence In the aftermath, I contacted Ethiopian Airlines repeatedly, reaching out through every possible channel: emails to their CEO, messages to customer service, and calls to their Accra airport management. Surely, I thought, they would want to address such an egregious oversight. I was wrong. Weeks turned into months without a single response. The silence was deafening. Initially, I connected with Mrs. Meron Masresha, the Team Leader at Ethiopian Airlines' Global Customer Interaction Center at Bole International Airport. She forwarded my complaint to Mr. Abiy Solomon, the Accra Airport Services Manager, who even requested my nephew’s contact details to discuss the incident directly. After I provided them, Ethiopian Airlines vanished once again—no follow-up, no email, no acknowledgment. It was as though my mother’s traumatic experience did not exist. A Blatant Breach of Trust This debacle extended beyond a simple inconvenience; it shattered the very foundation of trust. Ethiopian Airlines’ refusal to respond or provide even basic compensation reveals their blatant disregard for their customers. Their policies state that denied boarding compensation applies when a passenger meets all check-in requirements and is refused boarding for reasons beyond their control. My mother fulfilled every requirement, yet received no compensation, no refund, and no answers.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Accra to Atlanta via Bole,2024-08-01,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,no
10.0,Annie Wegner LeFort,United States,2024-10-26,appreciative of his persistence,"Not Verified | Because of a very tight connection on our return we had a feeling we might struggle with our luggage arriving on time. None of our bags arrived in Chicago, three were returned to us within 2 days and the 3rd was lost for 3 weeks. While this was inconvenient and frustrating, I am incredibly grateful for the help of customer service agent Frew. He worked very closely with me for those three weeks keeping me posted as best he could on the whereabouts of my suitcase, which we learned had been misdirected. Just when I thought I'd lost my bag forever, Frew called to tell me it'd been found. I am appreciative of his persistence to my case and was overjoyed to reunite with my luggage. He remained optimistic and focused, which helped me to stay calm about this situation.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa,2024-09-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes
1.0,Ramon Van der Rassel,United States,2024-08-25,the most terrible company,"Not Verified |  I started my trip at Antananarivo to Brussels, with a stop in Addis Ababa. At the airport of Antananarivo they could not give me a boarding card for the flight from Addis Ababa to Brussels. They told me to get a boarding card at Addis Ababa airport, but they checked in my luggage to Brussels. At Addis Ababa airport there were many people with problems as I had to wait for 2 hours at the customer service desk. They gave me a stand by ticket and said it would be no problem to get a seat, this was lie number 1. On the boarding card gate A10 was mentioned while on the screens B5 would be the gate to board for the flight ET730. I have asked customer service several times what the correct gate would be. They kept saying the correct gate was A10, even when boarding already started at B7, which was mentioned nowhere and was not on the screens, not even on the screen of gate B7, this was lie number 3. All customers with a stand by ticket, had to wait. Then they closed the door  and the plane left without many standby by ticket travellers. Our seats were not secured, the plane was overbooked.  After the plane left a supervisor promised us he would take care of an alternative flight, our luggage, compensation, and a place to sleep. Then he ran off and did nothing for us.  According to the policy of Ethiopian Airlines they should offer us a hotel to stay. After a few hours I finally managed to get a boarding pass for a flight one day later. I had to spend the night and day at the airport, got no food or drinks, nothing. Ethiopian Airlines is by far the most terrible company I have had a flight with, or actually no flight with.

10.0,T Neumann,United States,2024-08-22,staff very welcoming and supportive,"Not Verified | As disclaimer, I am a big fan of Ethiopian Airlines. They have such an amazing route network, and I just like the spirit onboard. On this trip, I once again was very happy with my choice. Here is why: The ticket fare was decent (and way cheaper than a major competitor), the flight times are just perfect (but I can easily sleep in planes), I liked the food and beverage service (incl. Habesha beer), the staff is very welcoming and supportive, and the coffee stop-over in Addis priceless. As an added (and very smart) bonus a free train ticket is included, so no need for silly short-distance flights to reach Frankfurt. OK, in-flight entertainment is just ok-ish, but I couldn't care less.

Sadly there is no other choice to fly within the country and why they do not care for keeping to schedules. I have had bags not loaded on another trip with 2 hours sitting on the runway in Addis.

1.0,L Gan,United States,2024-06-21,the luggage was never loaded,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight ET629 was delayed by over 5 hours owing to bad weather, resulting in our missed connection to Kigali. To cut a long story short, it was a nightmare to get ourselves on the next available flight. They had inexplicably put us on the following morning’s flight which would have meant that we missed 2 days of our tour instead of 1. They had the audacity initially to ask for additional payment of USD250 each for the earlier flight when we were prepared to downgrade from business to economy!. It was only with the intervention of 1 kind staff in ADD airport, that we managed ultimately to get on the next flight to Kigali. Arriving well past mid-night, we had a rude shock when we realised our luggage did not make it. This despite our conscientious checks at every leg of the travel with the ET staff. Every single one claimed that our luggage was loaded. It turned out that either every single one lied or the system was wrong. Through Star Alliance, we subsequently realised the luggage was never loaded in the first place from Bangkok. Adding insult to injury, not once did ET  apologize for the ordeal or contact us. We only learnt that our luggage arrived the next morning when the Rwanda Lost Luggage personnel called our agent to inform him. We requested ET to provide us with official confirmation of the various delays (in support of our insurance claims) and was again sent on a “not so merry go round” with again “sympathetic noises made” but no action or follow up. On the return flight, they refused to check in our luggage to the final destination in Singapore, claiming that they could not do so as our final leg was with Singapore Airlines. This despite the fact that Singapore Airlines is part of Star Alliance. It should be noted that Singapore Airlines was able to check our luggage in from Singapore to Kigali. In a separate call with Singapore Airlines, the staff confirmed that ET should have checked the luggage in all the way to Singapore. So again, we were severely stressed as we had to clear customs in Bangkok, collect our bags and check in again for our flight to Singapore. All to be done within 2 hours. Lo and behold, we ran to the luggage belt only wait and subsequently see “Delayed Baggage” - no explanation, no apology. It was nothing short of a miracle for us to eventually make it on our Singapore Airline flight.  To be fair, the service from the crew on board was good, the food was fair and the beverages good. But the rest of the ground staff (other than the one solitary gem - Amen) are a disgrace. I will not recommend anyone to take this airline.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Kigali via Addis Adaba,2024-06-01,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1,no

The gentlemen promised to look into my issue and said it would take time. Nothing has been said about that. Recently I requested to change my travel dates and to my surprise I was charged QR 150 yet there were still 7 days before departure. The attendant called it a penalty. I thought I had come in early but alas. Luggage is never on schedule and yet there are no concessions. If you are paying by card there is a 10.0% surcharge they actually want cash. We cannot be forced to give them cash through shady rules.

1.0,E Thane,United States,2024-06-10,Boeing 737 MAX 8 which is not ideal,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travel almost every weekend between Addis and Joburg. I have no choice but to use ET airlines as they have the only direct flights between these locations. First concern is that they use the Boeing 737 MAX 8 which is not ideal for international flights.  No entertainment for economy class for 5 hours, the lavatories  malfunction. On some occasions, ET will place us on the big Boeing with screens and entertainment, but my screen wouldn't work ... the flight attendant offered me the worst seat (next to the toilet). I declined, and she wasn't even bothered, no apology. The final stroke is when they wanted to take our hand luggage because there was no space in the plane. I don't think they respect the passengers going to South Africa.",Business,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Johannesburg,2024-06-01,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,no
2.0,K Markume,United States,2024-06-03,not be able to leave the airport,"✅ Trip Verified |  I communicated with the airline in advance that I would not be able to leave the airport because I was traveling with an emergency travel document If I bought the 10-hour layover in Addis Ababa from New York's final destination Namibia. The airline as per their policy offered me an in-terminal hotel. On check-in at JFK New York, the agent offered me a voucher for a Presidential hotel. I reiterated that I would not be able to leave the airport. She then said I could change my voucher on arrival in Addis Ababa at the customer service desk. My first experience in flight started with my screen being damaged with lines across the screen, seat 24H. I stayed in the same seat during our layover in Abidjan. On arrival in Addis, I was referred to the Interlink office. I have never been so belittled by a Customer service agent who had the nerve to tell me it was not his fault my passport was not valid. He went on to dismiss me and walked away as I was trying to get answers. His final response was that the Skyline hotel in the terminal was for business class travelers only. Two days ago, I looked at this hotel, and it would have cost me $75 for 5 hours. He offered me dinner and a public bench for 10 hours. I walked back to the customer service desk who offered me access to the gold lounge. He took me to a quiet room I could use, and as a woman, he allowed me to sleep in a darkened room with 4 strange men. I am sitting and writing this in the lounge trying to stay awake for the next 6 hours before my last leg to Windhoek.

1.0,N Hasseyn,United States,2024-05-27,a nightmare of a trip,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ethiopian airlines changed my flight ET844 from the 26th May to 28th May without informing me, I only realised they did that less than 24hrs, I called the call center and they could confirm changing my first leg from CPT to ADD, however they said they are waiting for confirmation from Egyptair because they operate the next leg from ADD to Cairo ( according to my original booking that should have been ET 452). I go to the airport CPT and they say it will be confirmed when I arrive in ADD. I arrive in ADD and they tell me my booking is confirmed but I will get my boarding pass at the gate and I have to wait in the airport for 7.10 hours. I told the officer please if my ticket is not confirmed then I can take the next day flight and get an hotel, he said no you are on this flight. 6 hrs later I go to the gate at 4 am (departure at 5.15am) and the woman at the gate A8 was the least helpful and very rude person, she refused to call interline and told me I am not on this flight and go sort it myself. I spoke to Egyptair and he told me its not my problem it is Ethiopian Airlines mess to sort out. At the end I had to wait for Interline officers to arrive, and they booked me on the next day's flight at 10pm, so I had to spend 24hrs in ADD airport.

I lost my luggage and launched a property irregularity report at JKIA Nairobi where I was provided a file reference number and online site to track it. A week went and no update. Their 'check status of the bag and manage file online' platform allows for editing and adding information to help trace the bag. I did all this, and after some days wrote a message in the same platform but no one responded back. I went to the Ethiopian website and located contact numbers for lost baggage plus email address. I tried the numbers listed and no one was picking. I wrote several emails and no response. This is the worst experience for Ethiopian Airlines having an online platform that is just there to fool the customers whereas there is no one who monitors it, and if there is, then they are just lousy.

4.0,P Watson,United States,2024-05-03,the worst I’ve experienced,"✅ Trip Verified | The quality of aircraft, food, entertainment and ground service are one of the worst I’ve experienced. Service is always friendly in the air though. The seat (business class) was dirty and the power did not work. The entertainment system must have been 15 years old with almost no new entertainment options. The food was overall pretty terrible - dry and weird tasting. I could not eat most of it.

3.0,E Roest,United States,2024-04-18,ultimately delayed by 4 hours,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was ultimately delayed by 4 hours, which caused several things to go wrong during our further journey. Firstly, a 1 hour delay was announced due to 'technical problems', then another 1 hour due to 'staff problems'. Then it is said that the flight has been moved to 4:30, so an additional 2 hours. After this, water and dinner are provided, for which thanks, but we can hardly sit anywhere. You are not allowed to take a seat in restaurants in the area. This should have been communicated between employees and a plan made. We then leave unclear what will happen next with the adjacent flight that we will miss; this was the 7 hour flight from Vienna to Amsterdam. An employee says they are going to rebook and we are receiving emails. We never received this. We arrive in Vienna and here Austrian airlines can solve it for you. They book a flight to Amsterdam via Frankfurt, which is first delayed to 7:30 PM and later cancelled. This leaves us stuck in Frankfurt. Then we had to rebook again to come to the Netherlands. We received this via Hannover, 9:10 on April 16. Initially there was no hotel included and we had to call Ethiopian airlines. Called this and the employee on the other end seemed to have poor English or had difficulty understanding us due to the connection. We understood her clearly. She tells us that ET has no accommodation and so we have to be on our own. Fortunately, we were still able to get a hotel voucher with dinner and breakfast from KLM. So they had provided something. A received respons from ET said this: First of all, we would like to thank you for choosing Ethiopian Airlines for your trip to Africa. We are deeply sorry and want to apologize for the inconveniences caused to you by the delay of flight ET 724 on 14.04.2024 from Addis Ababa Vienna. Of course, this does not comply with the high expectations of quality and service that Ethiopian Airlines promises and that our customers can expect on all of our flights. Regarding your claim for compensation due to the delay of the flights, we are sorry to tell you that Ethiopian Airlines is not able to meet your demands. The EG No. 261/2004 act from 17th December 2004 Art. 9 and the verdict of the EuGH from 19th November 2009 refer only to domestic flights or flights that depart from EU-countries and airlines that are registered in the EU. The settlement regarding compensation payment unfortunately is not applicable in your case which means that Ethiopian Airlines is not liable for compensation. Thank you for understanding that we cannot give any refunds for neither lump-sum payments nor subsequent damages like missed holidays or appointments. It is our utmost concern that you can put your trust in Ethiopian Airlines again on future flights, where we would be happy to prove our reliability to you once again.

The A350 with the 1-2-1 configuration is a fully flat seat with a reasonable amount of room. The IFE selection is limited. Ethiopian have a deserved reputation for short notice changes. Despite checking in 48 hours in advance on arrival at VFA we were told our seats had been changed. When we got to Addis Ababa on boarding we were moved again to my least preferred seats. Having spoken to their customer service people or more than one occasion and explaining to them we wanted a window seat, to be put in the middle two seats is not acceptable.

Over the last 30 years flew with many airlines business class, mainly Lufthansa or British Airways (over 1 million airmiles combined with all airlines) This Boeing 777-200 was put in service around 2004 to 2006, nothing was refurbished. Dated seat cover. The seats control was not working, the TV screen over 2 meter away, need binoculars to read the text. Remote control 20 years old and dated can not read what the function means and so small, you need a microscope to find he buttons. The LED screen dated all colour lost and poor picture quality. On top when choosing a film only the advert came on was not able to watch a film. Asked to get moved, but further 2 seats where broken only one middle seat, which I declined. Food was low quality, service nice but not what you expect, asking to get a complaint form, NO, you can only fill in a customer review on the screen, which you can not read and they only ask how great they are. Quality of drinks, worst ever, juice concentrate stabilised with citric acid and lot of sugar, asked for sparkling mineral water, received a poor tasting soda water, Paid Euro 3000 for this experience, my verdict, will avoid to book again I paid 100% of the fare and received maybe 80% I paid, Over the last, I was so lucky, that I had the same experience on my RETURN flight, looks they only use this aircraft Brussels - Vienna - Addis Ababa.",Business,Business Class,Vienna to Kilimanjaro via Addis Ababa,2024-02-01,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no
1.0,S Dlamini,United States,2024-02-22,zero customer service,"✅ Trip Verified | I was flying from CAI to JNB through ADD. 16th February 2024. As I arrived at the gate and was scanning my ticket to board the aircraft to JNB which was at 8:05 am, I noticed that I left my watch at the X-ray in ADD Terminal 2. I informed the ground agent and asked him that (I have to go back to get my watch as it is a branded original watch and it is not a cheap one that I can leave behind, at the same time I know which X-ray lane I was at so that won't take time) but he refused he was so careless and he just wanted to push me into the aircraft, so I spoke to his female colleague and she took my details to contact the security but she also was pushing me onboard. I boarded the aircraft, and nobody informed me anything, I spoke with the CM who was assisting with boarding she also seemed so sleepy and careless however she asked me to wait next to her as she would ask the ground agent to take me to the X-ray to get my watch as I shouldn't leave without the ground agent. when he came to the aircraft the CM asked him to assist me, but he shouted at me rudely and said (I will miss my flight and we are late) and all I needed to do is to go to the lost and found in JNB to assist me and he snapped at me in a very rude manner saying (easy isn't it?). The aircraft door was closed late around 8:50 so from 8:05 to 8:50 that was a very long time that I could have gone back to pick up my watch, so that was all a matter of rudeness and carelessness as even he should consider that it can be stolen, and I need to run back to grab it. Everyone cared only about pushing passengers onboard and closing the aircraft doors as we are objects, not humans. Honestly, zero customer service it is not a cargo flight it is a commercial flight where you deal with human beings, not parcels. When I arrived at JNB I reported to the lost and found for Ethiopian Airways as the ground agent in ADD, mentioned but they replied that they deal only with lost and found bags, however, they tried to assist by again taking my details. (and I’m sure the agent in ADD knew this information that they deal only with lost bags). Honestly speaking that was careless and rude and one of my worst experiences in any airline, I used to fly with your airline but never anymore. This story will go viral on social media as our lives and valuables should be your responsibility until our final destinations. And you should know that the competition is so high and offering a cheap ticket only is not what attracts passengers, what attracts passengers is good care and good customer service. As in my case, I saved one thousand rands to book for your airline over Egypt Air for example, but I lost a watch worth more than 10K. It would have been nice if he tried even if we couldn’t find it, but the attitude was terrible.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa,2024-02-01,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no
1.0,Cass Brown,United States,2024-02-05,told we cannot board our flight,"✅ Trip Verified | Autistic son and I were told we cannot board our flight. On 31 January 2024, my son and I were travelling from Nanjing to Cape Town. Coincidentally, it was also 04th birthday and we were blissfully excited about our journey. Unfortunately, the experience soon turned into what could be described as a nightmare. As I had not opted to check in my luggage, Ethiopian Airlines had already emailed the boarding passes for my son and me. So upon arrival in Hong Kong, we were asked for the boarding passes and allowed to enter Terminal 1, go through all the checks and searches and eventually arrive early at the Ethiopian Airline boarding gate. I approached the counter and spoke with a male representative (I’ll call him Kay). He informed me that I was meant to collect my luggage and check in before entering Terminal 1 etc. He spoke kindly and said that although I wouldn’t be able to get the luggage at that point, I could continue my journey to South Africa and on arrival at Cape Town International Airport, I would need to go to the baggage claim office, explain the situation that the baggage was not collected in Hong Kong, show them my baggage passes and ask them to write a report which would be sent to Hong Kong airport and then arrangements could be made to have the luggage sent to Cape Town. I was very grateful that this employee was solution-driven and offered such kind service that would not impact me severely as a customer. He then printed our boarding passes and asked me to have a seat. About 30 minutes later, passengers were boarding the plane and my son and I stood up. Again, the male representative who had spoken with me earlier said that I should have a seat, which we did. This was the last time I engaged with this representative. After there were only a few passengers left we went to wait in line. During this time, I witnessed two other passengers who had flown from the USA with United Airlines, whose luggage had not been accounted for. They were asked to stay behind, as I was, but they were soon allowed to board the flight. When my son and I got to the front, we were told that there was a problem, but the airline representatives could not tell me what the problem was. At this point, my son was stimming, as those with ASD sometimes do in stressful situations. He was sitting on the floor repeating letters of the alphabet and opposite words. A different male representative (I’ll call him Ray), then stood staring at my son. I explained to him that my son is autistic and that he sometimes stims in that way, but not to worry as he would soon stop. The same representative who was staring said nothing in response and continued to stare. After some minutes, this person then approached me with our boarding passes in hand and said that it was not the airline’s problem that our luggage was not collected and that unfortunately we would not be allowed to board the flight. At first, I thought he was joking, because he had a smirk on his face and his tone was condescending. He said that I would need to cancel the flight with the agent and see if I could rebook the flight. I told him that I didn’t fully understand the reason and asked if he could explain this. He then asked for a moment and walked away without offering any explanation or customer-centred behaviour. He was cold and unwilling to even speak to my husband who was on the phone with me at the time trying to help me.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Cape Town via Addis Ababa,2024-01-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
7.0,M Keele,United States,2024-01-13,its a pretty decent product,"✅ Trip Verified |  Family of 6 flying to Zanzibar for holiday. Ethiopian are (currently) our airline of choice for flying out of Stockholm to Africa. They have a daily overnight flight to Addis Ababa leaving at 9:50pm connecting with the rest of Africa which means that unlike the ME carriers you do not waste time flying too far east only to fly back. As three of our party of Star Alliance Gold we can bring the whole family to the lounges for free at all three points (Arlanda (7/10), Addis Ababa (5/10) and Zanzibar (3/10). We checked in at Star Alliance Gold and also managed to get advance boarding. This will all change for the worse when SAS leaves Star Alliance and goes for Flying Blue. Their App is well designed, clear, but maybe a tad slow to load but is probably most useful for retention of boarding passes. I recommend both their web based booking engine and check-in process. Biggest plus was on booking we were permitted to reserve all seats for the four legs on a basic economy ticket. This is a game changer when travelling in Africa (and Arlanda) when the differences of deplaning from as few as 10 rows can results in an hour difference in the queues for immigration. As for the flight its a pretty decent product. The aircraft are not the most modern. The FA service was professional including free unlimited drinks service and full food even on a 2.5 hour leg. Value for money wasn't bad considering we were flying around Christmas.

Remember that Ethiopian 5-10 years ago was a delightful company to fly with as the service provided was stellar and the logistical side of the business was fluid. Ethiopian Airlines has seen a major decline in the quality of the service it once provided. On my last flight, the air hostesses were mean and had a dirty attitude, I have been flying regularly since I was 10 years old; this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. When I got home from my flight I noticed that my suitcases had been severely damaged (They attempted to open my suitcase by ripping the zipper from the lock and broke both). When I contacted the airline by phone I was met with a very nasty voice and was not assisted.

We were about an hour late arriving into Addis which caused passenger with tight connections much concern, however there were staff there to assist them.

The IFE has a very basic selection of movies and TV shows, and not the latest ones. Most annoying was the fact that every show/movie automatically has Chinese subtitles, even if you don't like it. Food is basic but okay. Always choice between chicken and beef/fish. Drinks are given like twice a flight and if you call an attendant it takes a 5-10 minutes before they even give you a bit of attention (and not the happy one).

1.0,K Kemp,United States,2023-10-27,offered zero customer service,"✅ Trip Verified | We had two flights with Ethiopian Airways, 1. O’Hare to Addis Ababa and 2. Addis Ababa to Cape Town. Both flights we had a horrible experience. For the first flight the two of us initially purchased economy tickets but then upgraded to business class online for both passengers. At the check-in desk at O’Hare the workers informed us that 2 upgrades were placed under one name. They accused us of doing this and said our only options were for one of us to sit in economy or to pay the airport upgrade price, which was $500 more that what we paid for the online upgrade. After 20 minutes of arguing and speaking with a woman who identified herself as a supervisor, we surrendered and paid the airport upgrade fee so we did not miss our flight. Eventually I called and emailed Ethiopian Airlines and was refunded this. Why should customers have to fight for something we booked accurately AND paid for already? The online system couldn't have allowed me to do two upgrades on one person for one flight. It just is not possible. The second flight was the most jaw dropping events.....On 10/12 the plane flew from Cape Town from Addis Ababa relatively on time at around 1440. The captain announced overhead that we could not land because an aircraft on the runway had compromised the our ability to land (fuel or hydraulic fluid issue, which I learned several days later on my own). We flew around in circles for 45 minutes over Cape Town waiting for the runway to be cleared. The captain announced we would be landing in Cape Town shortly, workers were simply inspecting the runway to make sure conditions were optimal. Five minutes passed since the announcement and I noticed on the inflight 3D maps that the flight was rerouted heading north to Johannesburg. The captain did not inform us of this plan until 10 minutes after we were in route. How is this acceptable? What was supposed to be a 6 hour flight turned into TWO days of uncertainty, stress, no accommodations by Ethiopian Airways, and no guidance. Unexpected delays included; 45 minutes flying around Cape Town in attempts to land, a 120 minute unexpected flight to Johannesburg, 2.5hrs waiting on the plane in Johannesburg for a solution only to be told we needed to disembark, hours waiting to check into a hotel that was arranged by myself, TWO unplanned hotel nights in Johannesburg that were not compensated for, and a flight on 10/14 purchased by myself. Although this runway closure is not Ethiopian’s fault, the communication by Ethiopian was despicable. The were no instructions (hotel and future flight) or compensation given or even discussed. We were told we would be contacted via telephone for a future flight arrangement; however, two days later we heard nothing. In attempts to receive a departure flight out of Johannesburg, I called the customer service number 3 times; the evening of 10/12, the morning of 10/13, and the afternoon 10/13. On the morning of 10/13, I learned that the runway at CPT was open since it was noted on their social media. All customer service representatives said they had no information and we would be contacted. I gave up and purchased a flight to Cape Town with another airline. To this day and time we have not been contacted about a flight out of Johannesburg. Furthermore, while waiting on the plane for 2.5hrs in Johannesburg, the crew was far from apologetic and offered zero customer service.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Cape Town,2023-10-01,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

4.0,Melissa Kuun,United States,2023-07-19,upgraded seat which I never received,"✅ Trip Verified | 1. I paid for an upgraded seat which I never received. 2. In addressing the air hostess and head management I was told “ we are full so sit down” 3. The television screen was broken and I was told it would be reset, 6 hrs later nothing ! And don’t ask for ear headsets because they seem to decide when and who can have. These are not handed freely! 4. The staff chose to ignore general passengers when they ask for anything and often reply “I’ll go look, or let me see“ and never come back or just avoid getting to you at all. 5. They rudely wake you up when serving anything and if you ask for anything additional they feel the need to blame you for not taking at the right time. 6. Staff were untidy I would think pride in what you do starts from appearance. 7. This airline needs serious intervention and Management needs guidance on handling staff and passengers. 8. To top it off, they must know they are a problem as at the end of the flight not one member of the crew was found at the door exiting and I came from the back of the plane so they had ample time to converse and say farewell to passengers as all other airlines do, I suppose they knew what passengers would say to them and chose to go elsewhere.",Business,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa,2023-07-01,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2,no
3.0,Lindall Adams,United States,2023-07-15,seat I had reserved was no longer available,"✅ Trip Verified |  During my flight in July 2023, a delay occurred. The cabin crew assured us that the connecting flight would wait for Cape Town passengers and that ground staff had been informed. However, upon arriving at Addis airport, I found chaos with numerous delayed passengers and inadequate hotel accommodations arrangements. Furthermore, my in-transit luggage was missing for four hours, adding further inconvenience and the seat I had reserved was no longer available. I must highlight the unsatisfactory state of the toilets. One toilet was blocked, while another had accumulated years of sticky waste on the seat rim. Additionally, the cabin crew's uncooperative attitude in providing essential items for passengers, such as swallowing tablets or providing wipes for hand cleanliness, was concerning. Excessive noise from the kitchen area and lack of attention to passenger needs were also noticeable. I would acknowledge the contrasting experience provided in business class. I upgrade occasionally, or buy extra Shebamiles for upgrading or use Shebamiles. This is where passengers receive amenities like hot towels, menus, and recommendations regarding available choices.  As a loyal customer who has flown with ET since 2011, I am disappointed to see the evident disparity in treatment between economy and business class passengers. It is disappointing when flights scheduled to arrive on a specific day are delayed, causing passengers to arrive a day later. This lack of consistency with the DBX-Addis-CT flights is worrying.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Cape Town via Addis Ababa,2023-07-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1,no
2.0,B Thompson,United States,2023-07-08,extremely disappointed,"✅ Trip Verified | I am extremely disappointed with Ethiopian Airlines and their staff. During my recent flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Dubai, my friend and I checked in and received our boarding passes and luggage stickers. However, when we tried to load our luggage, we were told to go back to the line and check our tourist visa. We went to another counter to verify our visa with the agent name Meron Teklay (I appreciate her handling and she is well experienced) and then returned to the agent to drop off our bags, as we had our boarding passes and luggage stickers. Unfortunately, the agent was rude and refused to let us drop off our luggage, instructing us to go back to the line. It's frustrating that we completed all the necessary procedures but were still not allowed to proceed. I am aware that the Ethiopian government invested a significant amount of money in a smart checking system, but it seems like it is not being utilized effectively. I have personally traveled multiple times with a permanent residence permit for the United States of America and hold Silver Sheba miles status. This experience with Ethiopian Airlines on July 8, 2023, was the worst in terms of customer handling. I strongly believe that several Ethiopian Airlines travelers will share similar experiences and reviews very soon.

On phoning Ethiopian Airlines I was informed that they had now made the change only to find that the call center agent did not follow through and the change was cancelled.

Thereby passengers can have a good sleep after the dinner. The service is good except that the air hostess after dinner vanishes and arrives for cleaning up the leftovers just half an hour before landing and they do not have time to attend to passengers.

5.0,Craig Cutts,United States,2023-04-21,okay for what they charge,"✅ Trip Verified | First time using Ethiopian Airlines, check in at Heathrow T2 was pretty quick although the check-in agent failed to include my frequent flier status on the boarding pass which presented issues when trying to use the fast track & lounges, luckily I had a copy on my mobile. Used the SilverKris lounge which is good, boarding a bit disorganised but once onboard my seat 11A was comfortable enough. Flight departed on time for the 7 hour flight to Addis Ababa, service food (Dinner & Breakfast) and crew where okay. The PTV was also alright the seat not too bad, arriving Addis the transfer was straight forward and the airport itself wasn't too bad. I used the Cloud Nine Gold lounge which is a bit better than the general terminal, boarding the 2nd flight was again a bit of a mess. Another A350 and once again seat 11A however the seat had a fault so not too comfortable, crew where a bit vacant on this flight. The food a sandwich and lunch was again okay perhaps better than the first flight. Arrived CPT more or less on time after a flight of around 6 hours, bags delivered quickly so I suppose all in all Ethiopian got me from A to B & finally C without too much stress. I guess the one improvement would be the ground operation, it's pretty poor and rude at some points.

Took ages to disembark in Addis as they parked at a remote stand and there seemed to be a shortage of passenger buses. Transit in Addis is always a shambles. Massive queues at the security checkpoint with multiple lanes unmanned and extremely slow screening. Boarding is always chaotic at Bole Airport, especially if the aircraft is at a remote stand and you have to be taken by bus to the aircraft. Took off an hour late for Khartoum and, after an interminable wait for baggage after landing, discovered that the airline had left more than half the passenger baggage in Addis so they could carry more cargo, as evidenced by the dozens of boxes that arrived on the luggage conveyor as compared to very few suitcases. Basically sitting in Khartoum with just the clothes on my back now with absolutely no idea when/if my luggage will actually get here.

This is not the first time I fly Ethiopian. Addis to Bangkok on an old 777-200LR. Used the lavatory on ground before take off, it was already dirty with a lot of paper tissues on the floor. The entertainment system was not working at my seat and my neighbour next to me. Service after take off was not friendly, only one crew had a smile on her face. One crew was not happy that she had to open a pack of passionfruit juice for me being in the last row that she overfilled the cup and handed it to me that the juice was leaking on my tray table and my neighbours. Had to ask a few times for a napkin to wipe the mess and she pretended not to hear. Finally handed the napkin without looking at me and no apology. And why is Ethiopian using plastic cutlery? On way back one of my checked bag did not arrive at my destination. I had perishables including meat products. Luggage arrived 24hrs later. Tried to file a claim for compensation but excuses given by the airline that they cannot accept the claim. Very disappointing experience.

2.0,C Portero,United States,2023-02-14,Eventually I did not board,✅ Trip Verified |  I had a round ticket booked from Tokyo to Seoul. My mistake was researching in time that I needed a special ETA for Korea. That's 100% my responsibility. I tried to rebook my departure flight but they only do so via the call centre. The first agent advised to book on their platform but not to proceed with payment as only the price difference to the old ticket would matter and call them again instead. hey do not send out a payment link. You're forced to give your credit card number over the phone - which is not very safe. Anyway my payment did not go through. So I had no other option than pay at the check in counter the next day. The price went up. The check in counter did communicate with customer service. Hence the price tripled in less than an hour. The person at the counter instead spent 30 minutes printing out all kind of airline policy to prove why passengers must pay XYZ fees. He could have spent this time trying to solve this issue by for example engaging with customer service and holding a price. Eventually I did not board.

On arrival in Cape Town, my bag was a mess, they tampered with the lock and zip, luckily they couldn't open it. The bag looks like it was smashed against a hard surface, as the two legs were broken, beyond repair. I logged a complaint with Ethiopian Air when I landed in Cape Town on 14 December 2022. Since then I have made several enquiries regarding a replacement bag or some sort of compensation. No response whatsoever, just an acknowledgement of e-mail receipt. This is the worst airline when coming to customer care. My advise, when travelling using this airline, try not to take a large bag, that will exceed the maximum weight that you can take into the cabin.

2.0,DC Galante,United States,2023-01-31,service has been utterly shocking,"✅ Trip Verified | From the minute I crossed the boarding gate to now I have had a terrible experience with Ethiopian Airlines. Firstly my flight in Oman was delayed by 40 minutes, this meant when I arrived in Ethiopia I had to run to catch my connecting flight. The Addis Ababa airport is an absolute nightmare - a bottle neck of thousands and thousands of people squeezing and pushing trying to all get through security. I nearly missed my flight to Johannesburg. When I get onto the plane I realise I did not have the same seat I booked - when I went through the gate where they scan your ticket I was given a different ticket by the person at the counter but I didn't think anything of it. This person did not even bother to tell me he was moving me from a front row aisle seat to a third row middle seat. When I asked the air hostess why my seat had been moved she said they had a VIP they had to give my seat to. I felt absolutely disrespected - like I did not matter - how could they just move me to a middle back seat without even speaking to me about it? The food on the flight was terrible - I could not even eat it - I had two bites because I was so hungry but left the rest. The food was so dry and tasteless, and really just not good at all. Both of the planes also had really weird smells on them. When I landed in South Africa (after being awake for 37 hours) I stood at the carousal for over an hour waiting for my bag but it did not come out. Thanks to my airtag I could see that my bag was still in Ethiopia. I was so exhausted, dirty and so angry that I just burst into tears - the man at the EA counter did not know what to do with me. He assured me that I could go buy clothes and toiletries for $80 and I could just claim it back from Ethiopia Airlines. Although this was a huge inconvenience because I was leaving for Cape Town 2 days later, I felt better knowing they would fit the bill for the extra things I had to go buy. My bag only arrived 29 hours later and the lock on my bag was also broken. I submitted my claim two and a half months ago and have still not received my reimbursement or any feedback from them. I have sent so many emails following up on my reimbursement and I have had no response. I have also filled out an online form on their website and have sent a message to their Facebook page. I have sent hundreds of emails but they just ignore me. Their service has been utterly shocking every step of the way - this is definitely not Africa's best airline.

1.0,E Martin,United States,2022-12-30,One of the worst airlines I have encountered,"✅ Trip Verified |  One of the worst airlines I have encountered. My husband and I were supposed to take a trip from Chicago to Dubai connecting through Addis Ababa with Ethiopian airlines. We got to the airport well ahead of time, checked our baggage and got to the gate for our flight. We were told the flight was delayed but wasn't given any other information. We waited around for a few hours and were told to wait in the lounge. Waited again for a while, and my husband went to the airline counter only to find out the flight was cancelled due to some mechanical issue. We were told to go home and to come back the next day to be put on an 11am flight. We asked for our checked baggage back but Ethiopian airlines wouldn't give it back. We showed up to the airport the next day at 6am only to find out the mechanical issue was still going on and Ethiopian airlines didn't know when it would be fixed. They asked all the passengers to write down their email addresses on a piece of paper and that they would contact us when they had more information. At this point, we had already lost 2 days of our 10 day multi-city vacation. We went to United airlines (as our flight was a codeshare airline) and they managed to cancel our Ethiopian airlines ticket and were able to find us a last minute flight to Dubai. We went back to Ethiopian airlines to get our checked baggage back for the new flight and they refused to give the baggage as they claimed it had cleared security and they didn't have enough ""manpower"" to unload the luggage. Ethiopian airlines reassured us that that checked baggage would follow us to Dubai. We even let them know that we would only be in Dubai for another 3 days since we would be traveling to another destination after that, yet Ethiopian airlines assured us that our baggage would get to us. We got to Dubai and filed a baggage claim there. We waited for our baggage to arrive and even went back to Dubai airport only to find out the baggage was missing. We had to do a 14 day trip without our checked baggage and spend a good portion of our trip trying to buy a new suitcase, new clothes, etc. I'm very disappointed with Ethiopian Airlines.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,Chicago to Dubai via Adis Ababa,2022-12-01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,no

1.0,S Thomas,United States,2022-12-27,will never used Ethiopian Airlines again,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst airline ever. My experience flying with Ethiopian Airlines was awful. From check in at Heathrow airport the staff were rude, service very slow. I had to pay for excess luggage, the agent at the ticket office counter seemed confused and she was very slow. Once we boarded, when dinner was served the only 2 options were either rice and fish or pasta and tomato sauce. As I am allergic to fish the only option for me was the pasta and tomato sauce. I asked for another meat option and I was told that chicken was "" finished"" . So I had to eat the pasta which was not well cooked with tomato sauce as I was hungry otherwise I wouldn't have eaten it. The airport upon landing in Addis Ababa was another experience, separate issue. I connected to Harare from Addis Ababa. Upon arrival in Harare I got 1 of my checked in bag and the other one was missing. The airport staff advised that it happens all the time ""when the plane is full Ethiopian Airlines removes some random bags and they follow with the next flight"". Shocking! So my bag was missing, there was no announcement from the crew that some bags has been left behind, no communication whatsoever. I don't live in Harare, I had to stay in Harare overnight so I could return to the airport the following day to check whether my missing bag was on the next day's flight.

There truly has been a major decline on the quality of service provided to Cloud Nine passengers. Furthermore, there always seems to be some sort of delay with their flights. On my most recent trip, such delay caused me to miss my final connection (from Toronto to Phoenix) which resulted in me being stranded for over 14hrs. There was no apologies or any attempt from Ethiopian airlines to get me to my final destination sooner.

1.0,M Baker,United States,2022-12-04,no words will describe how diabolical this service was,"✅ Trip Verified | What a complete rip-off. Abysmal customer service that stole my money. I booked this flight for my elderly parents and paid to upgrade their seats well in advance. I received confirmation of the seat booking and they debited the money from my account. When we went to check in online we noted that the seats had not been allocated as per the pre-payment. I went to see the Ethiopian Airlines office in person and met what can only be described as the worst customer service agent ever and I have met some awful ones before. Not only did she tell me that it was not paid for despite seeing the receipt and proof of the money leaving my account but then she told me it was not her problem and I should contact the helpline. I asked to see her manager and was told there was none. After getting very angry she went off and returned over 15 minutes later and said everything had been arranged and the seats were allocated. Imagine the shock my parents got when to check in and were given separate seats and not the pre-paid ones. This happened on both legs of the journey. What can you say, no words will describe how diabolical this service was. They are happy to take the money and happy to have customer service reps that lie to you and clearly check-in staff that are not qualified to do their jobs.

I asked many times and they just answered that they don't have any. The light on the top was also on all  trip, on my face for 16 hours and it wasn't working as well and of course they couldn't do anything about. The crew from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo and the other crew from Sao Paulo to Ethiopia were rude, answering in a bad mood, making faces between them and running and shouting at people, it was just terrible. I didn't travel with my husband so I expected some help from the crew but nothing happed, when they saw me carrying my baby and bags and my other daughter was scared, they didn't even try to help me.

Emailing is slightly better but I would have to send the same information several times before I got anyone to do anything. Finally I booked our flights. Two weeks before we were due to fly they canceled one of the bookings and said we would have to change the dates. After much stress with emails and calls I finally sorted it out.

As soon as you need them, you realize that they are not professional at all. They just want your money, they will assist you, call you to book your ticket, but as soon it's done, you're not longer their priority. I was flying from Douala to Lomé, then from Lomé to New York JFK (07/25/22), They lost my bag. And till today no bag, no news from them. I don't even remember how many times I tried to call them, it just rings, they don't pick up, it's like you calling a personal phone.

Pilot announced aircraft had a Hydraulic Pump Failure and could not fly same Day since they needed spares. So we were taken into the Lounge Room at Dublin. We were kept in Lounge room for 11 hours without anything to eat, not even a cookie. There was no Ethiopian Airlines Staff present.

Only the day after when a new flight from Abidjan to Addis Ababa was coming (24 hours after cancelled one), they informed me that they had changed my booking to fly over Dubai and then to Bahrain with flydubai. This will prolong my flight time with 29 hours, and I miss a full day at work. This itinerary appeared from my online booking but they did not give me any boarding pass or other kind of documentation. They just told me to deal with it in Dubai. Arriving in Dubai at 3am well in advance of my flight with flydubai scheduled for 7:15am, turns out that Ethiopian Airlines had not made any booking for me. The staff from flydubai tells me that their only chance to rebook me is the night flight at 17:00 thus I could look forward to 10 hours in Dubai airport. I run back to the gate where Ethiopian Airlines is boarding the flight back to Addis Ababa, there was a full queue of people waiting to board the flight back to Addis Ababa. I joined the end of the queue and waited until it got my turn. I kindly told one of the Ethiopian Airlines staff that once he had finished with boarding the passengers, I had a claim.

1.0,J van Keeren,United States,2022-08-11,an unpleasant and long flight,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ethiopian Airlines is a disappointing airline. The first flight should not have taken place in the plane we flew in. It was not maintained well. The roof boards were loose. The bathroom was duck taped together. The sink section came out of its socket and was open up. The plane should be taken in for proper maintenance.  The food is terrible and I’m one who enjoys plane food. The chicken was rubbery and bland. I recommend bringing your own food. The staff barely offer you something to drink and when the staff were told about the damage they did not attend to it. The equipment on the plane is old and some lucky passengers were given earphones and a blanket, we had to request these items. The second flight was somehow worse. The flight was overbooked. The food was even worse than the first flight, inedible except the bread and cheese. The staff kept the cabin lights on throughout the night so it is impossible to sleep. I requested three times for the cabin lights to be turned off during the dark and I was ignored even though this was possible on the first flight. The seating is uncomfortable and small.  This flight ran out of drinkable water. The movies were outdated and it was an unpleasant and long flight. If you travel far I recommend Qatar Airways, it’s more worth the money you pay. I have travelled on many flights with many airlines but I will never fly with Ethiopian Airlines again.

My flight was delayed 7 hr at the start of my itinerary. I was never updated on the new departure time. I kept calling the global center (7x) and they would not verify the new departure time! My flight eventually left at 4am instead of 9pm but I missed all my connections and the start of my safari vacation. All my vacation plans had to be changed at last minute and this was extremely stressful. Then Ethiopian airlines lost my luggage for 7 days. No one from the airlines would help me. They kept saying they had no idea where the bag was even though I knew it was in Addis! The Ethiopian website is not helpful as it is not ever updated! No one contacted me so I had to spend my safari time following up. Finally after 5 days the airline said they would compensate me $100 for the lost bag…but no one at Ethiopian Global office nor in DC would assist me. I am not able to get the compensation! The airlines said they can not help me and I needed to speak with their offices in South Africa! This has been a nightmare experience ! Especially on a business class ticket. For my safari, I was without clothes for half the vacation. Now I Can not get compensation. Everyone I speak to at Ethiopian airlines is extremely rude. No one will let me speak to a manager, or assist me or say they are sorry. On my way home, I had to fight to sit in the Ethiopian lounge. They said I could not sit in the lounge for more than 3 hr and my layover was longer. When I checked on my luggage in Johannesburg , they told the lounge staff I did not have any bags checked in although I had bag tags to prove I had checked luggage - my bag was missing again.

Had to spend lots of money on locksmiths and toiletries as all ours were in our travel luggage. Ethiopian Airways contact center is very difficult to reach, they keep you on hold for almost an hour then it just hangs up. After eventually making contact with the call center a day later they are unable to say where the bags are or if they even have the bags and that they will only offer compensation if they haven’t been able to locate the bags after 25 days.

2.0,Tim Harris,Switzerland,2022-06-30,"Don't fall for the cheap prices, you will pay for it in other ways","Not Verified |  I flew Ethiopian Airlines roundtrip from Toronto-Nairobi and back. In Kenya I bought another Ethiopian Airlines to Cairo - roundtrip. My experiences were horrible and despicable to say the least. First, on my return trip to Nairobi from Cairo, a big roach fell out of my food tray. I brought the attention of the cabin crew who took my boarding pass, took a picture and promised to file a report. Nothing happened! Then on my return flight to Toronto, I paid for a seat in premium economy for extra leg room. The money was charged to my credit card. When I got to the airport, they couldn't find my ticket and had to wait 2 hours for them to figure it out. They finally did and I was issued a boarding pass for the flight. In Addis Ababa, I presented my boarding pass and was told there is a seat change. I thought they were upgrading my seat due to the roach incident and the delay in Nairobi. Nope! They rather downgraded me and gave my seat to another passenger. When I protested I was threatened by a very unprofessional, rude and disrespectful agent at the counter. They threatened to unload my luggage from the plane if I do not take the downgraded seat assigned to me. Bottom line, Ethiopian Airlines in the absolute worst airline.

9.0,Paul Mercer,Switzerland,2022-05-29,would not hesitate to fly them again,"✅ Trip Verified | Check-in went smoothly and was opened 4 hours before the flight. Boarding was a relatively painless process and although masks were required a lot of passengers were not wearing them at the end of the flight. The aircraft was clean although some of the IFE screens stopped working (see picture) mid-flight. The meal was a lot more tasty than it looks – I opted for fish – but options had ran out for the passengers at the back and they were left with just pasta. I had a small bottles of euro wine which was probably undrinkable at ground level but was OK at 36,000 feet. We had fruit and a croissant for breakfast. Exiting the flight was slow largely because of the amount of hand baggage that was allowed. Overall it was good-value flight with some significant issues and the option of two 23kg bags for the basic economy price. I have flown Ethiopian several times – in both business and economy – and would not hesitate to do so again.",Business,Economy Class,London to Addis Ababa,2022-05-01,4.0,5.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,5,yes
4.0,Francis Wong,Switzerland,2022-05-04,maintenance and cleanliness is a disgrace,"✅ Trip Verified |  Although this is an 787, one of the newer aircrafts of Ethiopian airlines, the maintenance and the cleanliness is a disgrace. Service is OK, crew weren't enthusiastic, but at least got the job done. Seats are OK, considered it's 3x3x3. Many seats have malfunctioned entertainment systems. The meals were so so. The toilet is not kept clean and in a sorrowful state. All the windows on the left side of the plane failed to darken, causing passengers on that side suffering from too much glare form the sunlight, many had to use their pillow to block the window, which was funny to see. Lucky for me this is only a 2 hour flight. The plane touched down in HK airport very roughly with a loud thug and a huge bump, which startled and frightened all of us.

1.0,Maja Novak,Switzerland,2022-05-04,We had to sit separately,"Not Verified |  This was the worst airline I have travelled long distance. Neither flight was I able to sit together with my partner (all together we had 4 flights). We had to sit separately. The seats were broken. The seats in the last row were absolutely ruined, full of springs, on the way back my seat was not fixed - I could remove seating area. I also could not lean back my seat so for 5 hours I needed to sit straight up, sitting between two strong men who took up even 1/4 of my space from each side - it was the same on 2 flights. The seating area is narrow, not comfortable. One plane did not have entertainment so they say we can watch it on our smart phones but it did not work. The food was not good, they ran out of white wine. Stewardesses were not as kind as other airlines.

Once we found her passport we were trying to book with the same flight the following day and the man at the customer service desk had an attitude as soon as he saw us and ignored us. He tried to charge us $300 each for switching the flight because he was clearly frustrated we missed it. Another staff went out of her way to check on us and confirm we found the passport.

3.0,Titi Kebede,Switzerland,2022-04-12,My experience was not a pleasant one to say the least,"Not Verified |  I used the airline App to purchase a ticket one month before my travels from the United States to Ethiopia and was able to reserve a specific seat at the same time. I reserved seat 50L because of my high blood pressure condition. I needed to be seated away from any active passengers to ensure I would be able to have enough sleep which was necessary due to my medical condition. On the day of my travel to Ethiopia I went to check in and discovered my seat was changed from 50L to 13B which was next to children and was in the middle. I spoke with your ticketing agent at the airport who was not willing to assist me. I then spoke to a Manager who told me they are not selling seats but are selling tickets and that seat reservations made in advance didn’t really matter. I was almost crying because the airline staff were very rude and not willing to assist me at all. I feel they were calling me a liar telling me that I had not reserved seat 50L. Another passenger who overheard my conversation with your Manager gave me her seat which helped with my situation. Once I arrived in Ethiopia I went to the Addis Ababa office Which is the one in Addis Ababa to speak with someone concerning the negative experience I had with my seat reservation. Your staff member took my statement and I was told by her that I would receive an email containing the report your staff member had written. As of today, I have not received an email. I then asked her for assistance with my seat reservation for my return flight. She confirmed seat 50L was reserved for me and apologized for the negative experience I had on my flight to Ethiopia. Three days prior to my return flight back to the United States, I checked to confirm once again that I was seated in seat 50L. I then discovered that my seat reservation had been changed to seat 27B. I was really upset and when I contacted your airline I was told my seat had changed due to a change in the aircraft for the return flight. I asked why your airline does not send out an email when they change a passengers seat reservation, the agent on the phone for your airline told me that the best seat is always given to a Crew member. I was completely was shocked to hear that. I went to the Ethiopian Airlines office again to fix my seat reservation to what your agent had reserved for me. I spent three days of my vacation going from one office to another office to resolve my seat reservation problem as your App was giving me a system error. My negative experience with Ethiopia Airlines makes it less likely that I will use your airline for my travels to Ethiopia. I feel your management team needs additional training in customer service and your reservation system needs to be looked at so that your customers are alerted via email when their seat reservation has been changed.

All other airlines let passengers change their tickets a minimum of two times, but I guess you want to give out bad experiences to everyone who tries to book with you. It's unacceptable that you expected me to fly last year during a time when borders were not even fully operating and you would not even let me change the destination so that I could at least fly somewhere where COVID restrictions were better. You only gave me a voucher to use within 2021 as if we were not in the middle of a global pandemic. This specific ticket I had booked with 3 other friends of mine, everyone received a refund from their airline except me and I had been battling with this case for two years now. You should at least have a policy that allows you to change your ticket if it's of a significant amount, which mine was.

4.0,P Mercer,Switzerland,2022-02-03,giving priority to its employees over passengers,"✅ Trip Verified |  Having flown on Ethiopian Airlines number of times before I knew what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that the A350 had its latest business seats which were fairly standard although hiding the remote control in a cupboard did not seem to make much sense. As I arrived, despite only half the seats being occupied at that point, all of the overhead bins occupied and many of them were larger than the size the airline allows. I asked one of the cabin crew what was happening and she conceded – very apologetically – that all of the bags belonged to crew members. I managed to squeeze my bag next to an oversized pilots’ case. There seem to be at least five pilots occupying seats largely at the front of the business cabin which, of course, meant that they were served food and drink first. If Ethiopian Airlines wants to achieve reputation for being the best airline in Africa then it should try to emulate best practice and seemingly giving priority to its employees over passengers who had paid a significant amount of money to fly business class is not the best way of doing this. The cabin crew seemed embarrassed but clearly did not feel able to challenge their pilots. Other than this irritation the flight was smooth, the service efficient, the seats comfortable and both getting on and off the aircraft went smoothly.",Business,Business Class,London to Addis Ababa,2022-01-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,3,yes

Not the best but better than many. I recently flew from ADD to IAD. This was a horrible flight. 1) A flight attendant was serving water in the cabin (nice since they confiscated all water bottles before boarding). I was seated in the back of a cabin. She ran out of water and never came back. Who cares? 2) The food and beverage service was absolutely the slowest I've ever seen in my life (out of about 100 trans-Atlantic flights). You would have had to work hard to go any slower. There were two flight attendants serving - and two standing around doing absolutely nothing. I have never see a lazier group of flight attendants in my life. 3) The food was worse than bad - inedible. The beef was nothing but grizzle and fat - I wouldn't serve this to my dog. No plan or organization for service - none. Terrible flight. Among the worst flights I've been on. The cabin crew was lazy beyond words.

My travel agent booked this new flight in coach and I upgraded to business at airport. It was cumbersome with no agents on ground knowing what to do and finally having to speak on the phone with ET reservations. Took about 35 minutes. Ticket counter staff was courteous but clueless. I was the only business class passenger EBB-ADD. Equipment was an aging 777 with a tired interior. But seats quite comfortable and, in fact, I found the Ethiopian older business class seats far more comfortable than United's over-hyped Polaris service. Transit in ADD was fast and smooth. ET lounge was excellent, comfortable and very courteous service. There was a resting room and buffet of western and Ethiopian food. ADD-JNB flight was practically full both business and coach.

My daughter was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Madagascar, who intended to take a short trip home just prior to the pandemic. Just days before her scheduled flight, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a massive evacuation, therefore making her trip null and void. During the process, Ethiopian offered little to no support to my daughter while on the ground in Madagascar. Nevertheless she returned home. Upon her return, we spent the next year and a half trying to negotiate a refund for her flight. First the company offered a voucher good for one year (that we would not be able to use during the pandemic). Then, I sent a series of 7 emails to various company email addresses. I was able to get a response from a reservation representative, but when I provided the requested information, she never responded, despite assigning me a case reference number.

We realise the items were slightly taller than carry-on limitations, but this was never a problem with other airlines in the past and other passengers had similar size souvenirs on board. At the check in counter, we were told that it is not possible to take the souvenirs on board and that we need to check them in. We told the employee that the items are very fragile and very expensive, he told us that the airline has separate containers for fragile items and that the souvenirs will not be damaged. We reluctantly agreed as we were not presented with any other options. On our arrival to Milan, we could immediately see that the package was handled with extreme negligence!

It was an A350 with the old-style side-by-side seating which, if there is nobody next to you, is probably better than the new seats. Having slept on both within several days the old seemed more comfortable than the new. Boarding was quick and painless and I was quickly served with a glass of (almost) chilled champagne. Topping it up is always a nice touch. The cabin was very clean and the surfaces had clearly been wiped. The temperature was perfect throughout – warm enough for a good sleep. I opted for the fish and although it was served on a tray, it was on a dish with metal cutlery. It would have been nice to see a printed menu but I could understand why. The cabin and flight crew were meticulous in following covid rules and the toilets were kept spotless. One of the advantages of covid flying in near-empty business sections – and therefore less chance of being near a heavy snorer. There were occasionally bumpy patches but, unlike some airlines, the pilots did not resort to switching on the seat belt sign every time or leaving it on too long. There was really nothing that one could fault with this flight and, for the price and the timing, it offered excellent value for money. The only change the airline should make is offer business passengers free wifi.",Business,Business Class,Addis Ababa to London,2021-01-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,4,yes
7.0,Paul Mercer,Switzerland,2021-01-15,Food was OK but not memorable,✅ Trip Verified | Having received an email from the airline telling me I had to arrive at the airport FOUR hours before the flight I then waited an hour before staff arrived. They hadn’t a clue why we had received the email. Business passengers go through a separate entrance which I suspect was slower than the normal route. Two pleasant immigration officers spent an inordinate amount of time checking my exit form. The lounge was empty when I arrived except for the Ethiopian crew gorging themselves. The lounge has PIR-activated lights which kept on switching themselves off if no movement was detected. Equally annoying were the continual announcements that the country had banned the use an import of plastic bags in order to “save the environment”. All very worthy. Boarding was relatively quick with the ground crew insisting that everyone wore a mask. Again very encouraging – except many passengers had half-removed them before they reached the aircraft including a returning pilot sitting in business. The aircraft was a little worn but adequate. I received a warm glass of champagne but had to ask for it. Food was OK but not memorable. As we approached Addis I obediently complied with the cabin crew’s request to put my seat upright – but the pilot sitting in business evidently believed that the rule did not apply to her and remained reclined during landing.,Business,Business Class,Dar es Salaam to Addis Ababa,2021-01-01,2.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,3,yes

There was no business priority lane. The only lounge open was Lufthansa’s uninspiring offering with beer or wine being served from a desk and a selection of food. Despite travel restrictions most LHR T2 travellers seemed to be retired couples. Boarding was slow with no priority for business but once on board it was a nice surprise to discover it had the new individualised seat layout. Cabin crew was quick to serve a glass of champagne and a refill. The movie selection was dire. Wi-Fi failed to connect to the satellite throughout the flight. The food choice was beef, chicken or fish and although it was served in a more premium economy style – a covid precaution – it was more than sufficient. The cabin crew was attentive in keeping my glass full. The flat bed was slightly narrow but not to extent that I was unable to sleep.

9.0,Paul Mercer,Switzerland,2021-01-11,cabin crew were efficient and pleasant,✅ Trip Verified |  It was a nice surprise to find a 787 rather than a 737 that they often use on this route. Although it had an old-style side-by-side business seats the front of the plane almost empty and so it was not an issue. A glass of champagne was served very promptly and refilled – a nice trick other airlines should learn. The choice of food was limited to chicken or beef and I chose the former which came covid-style but with a pleasant couscous and prawn. There is no Wi-Fi on the aircraft and I did not check the movies. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant.,Business,Business Class,Addis Ababa to Dar es Salam,2021-01-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,5,yes
9.0,S Karykas,Switzerland,2021-01-10,airline seems to do a very good job,"✅ Trip Verified |  Online check in through the app very good. Luggage drop off in Athens, was a biut chaotic as there were a lot of people with excessive luggage on the counter line. The agents were very good though. The 1st flight was delayed more than an hour, however as I had almost 5 hours stop-over in Addis Ababa, this was not a problem. The flight was coming from Moscow and the majority of the passengers were from Russia. Almost full, however no-one next to me. Comfortable aircraft and seat and good food service (hot tasty meal). Cabin crew wear traditional Ethiopian dresses, which looks very nice and they are polite and nice, although strict regarding the wearing of masks (which they should be). Addis Ababa is a big hub, very busy in the morning that we arrived (although during covid times). A lot of aircraft arrive at the same time and many passengers have to catch connecting flights, this was done efficiently though. The airport is not particularly luxurious or extra comfortable, however not bad either. Would have preferred a shorter connection, however I knew about it when I booked it. The 2nd flight was on time, uneventful, another nice warm meal in a 2 hour flight. Landing smooth and collected luggage pretty quickly. This airline seems to do a very good job, is the leader in African aviation and competes well all major carriers - seems that they directly compete the Gulf carriers on many routes pretty well.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Entebbe via Addis Ababa,2020-12-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes
4.0,E Mawes,Switzerland,2020-12-28,they informed me a PCR was required,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Cape Town to Dubai via Ethiopia. The Dubai government website states a PCR test can be completed on arrival in Dubai. When I checked in at Cape Town airport Ethiopian airport staff did not request a covid test to board my first leg to Ethiopia. However I was denied boarding in Ethiopia as they informed me a PCR was required. I was forced to spend 2 days in Ethiopia waiting for a PCR test which was costly. I understand requirements need to be met but I’m deeply dissatisfied that the PCR wasn’t requested to board in Cape Town as the airline were well aware of my entire journey and end destination. When I raised the matter with the airline their only response was that it was mentioned on their website.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Dubai via Ethiopia,2020-11-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3,no
1.0,Rodrigue Kitindi,Switzerland,2020-12-23,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,"Not Verified |  We arrived at the airport well in advance, before 10:30hrs for a 13:40hrs flight. Their service was extremely slow; people started to pay agents working at the airport in order to jump the queues. They decided to stop accepting passengers very early. All the agents just disappeared and there was nobody to ask what was going on. The Airport Authority staff told us that this has been happening since Sunday 20/12/2020, and passengers are put on next day's flight, which makes them close early as all seats become occupied.  With the Covid-19 certificate being valid for 72 hours only; everything becomes so complicated. We don't know what Ethiopian Airlines agents will say tomorrow, neither do we know what the staff at Ministry of Health will say about the Covid-19 certificate. Ethiopian Airlines need to stop this practice.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kinshasa to London via Addis Ababa,2020-11-01,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4,no

Due to Covid further restrictions and to bear in mind the political violence escalating in Ethiopia we were in no position to fly. I have now called them 24 times to speak to anyone on this and no one has answered a call - I have emailed - no reply. When we try to go cancel on the site - it crashes - looks very like a case of we have your money, you don't exist.

2.0,Christina Christoforou,Switzerland,2020-11-16,My trip lasted a total of 21 hours,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had booked my ticket from Nairobi to Athens via Addis Ababa and the airline cancelled my scheduled flight due to COVID. When the airline resumed flights and I went to change my ticket, I was informed that the price had gone up (to double in fact) and even though it was a ticket I had already paid for, I had to pay for it again.  24 hours before departure I tried to check in online, but only the first part of my flight was available for check in. When I arrived at the airport ET had cancelled my flight from Addis to Athens, without notifying me, and had also booked me to fly 24 hours later, meaning I had to spend a day in Addis and arrive to my destination with 36 hours delay. The only way for me to reach my destination on the day i had planned (which was important) was to fly via Rome, adding 9 hours to my trip, and a lot more risk of contracting COVID, as i had to wait for hours at the airport and later fly with a plane that for some reason was crowded in the front half, while the second half remained empty. My trip lasted a total of 21 hours, and cost 1100$. My husband flew a day later with Lufthansa, and was there 12 hours later, having paid 600$. when I complained about this and requested to be refunded the difference I paid, someone replied  'Please kindly note that whenever schedule change or routing change occur we understand as our passengers’ plan may be disrupted but sometimes such decisions are necessitated due to operational or unforeseen circumstances'. After having flown with this airline a few times, I have come to the conclusion that it's ok to fly with them if if everything goes smoothly, but if something goes wrong and you need assistance and customer service, they become the worst.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nairobi to Athens via Addis Ababa,2020-09-01,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1,no
9.0,Paul Mercer,Switzerland,2020-11-16,The aircraft was exceptionally clean,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was done efficiently – we were in zones and to prevent the inevitable attempts at queue-jumping staff were there to tell people to go to the back on the line. Masks were obligatory but social distancing was not. The aircraft was exceptionally clean and many of the seats in economy were empty – which is always a recipe for a pleasant flight. Toilets were clean. There was a broad selection of movies and the aircraft had decent screens. The only problem is that the controls are mounted in the arm rests which meant that occasionally the movie would freeze as your arms brushed against the panel. The flight was slightly delayed but arrived on time. Food was served promptly – a choice of beef or chicken with a roll, crackers, cheese and a biscuit. Although nothing special it was more than adequate. There was more wine if you asked. On landing at LHR there was the usual long walk at T2 and then delays at the eGates as passengers wondering why they were not working while they were wearing masks. The bags also took a long time to load onto the belt. Having flown on a 787 and then an A350 in quick succession, with identical seats, the latter would be my preferred aircraft: the flight seemed smoother and quieter and it simply felt better. Given the cheapness of the ticket this flight offered incredible value for money especially as it included one hour free wifi.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to London Heathrow,2020-11-01,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes
9.0,Paul Mercer,Switzerland,2020-11-09,a more pleasant journey than in pre-lockdown days,"✅ Trip Verified | Heathrow Airport is operating in lockdown mode and therefore check-in and security were very quick. Most of the restaurants were closed, although it was possible to buy some drink and food to be eaten on the chairs. Boarding the aircraft was done efficiently and it was about half full which meant that I had three seats to spread across. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The food was served in a box with a choice of chicken or beef. There was no problem with asking for another small bottle of wine or beer. We left on time and arrived slightly early. The aircraft was wi-fi equipped with one hour free access and a modest fee after that. The connection was remarkably fast. Given the price of this flight it offered great value and, with the lack of passengers at the airport and on the plane, was arguably a more pleasant journey than in pre-lockdown days.",Business,Economy Class,London to Addis Ababa,2020-11-01,4.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,5,yes
4.0,S Rose,Switzerland,2020-11-08,Forget Social Distancing,"✅ Trip Verified |  Packed A359 from Dubai to Addis. Cabin temperature too warm, WiFI not working. Cabin crew very nice and attentive, meal was a typical C19 box with dry items and a hot casserole. Dry items were horrible, some small red beans salad in a sauce, bread hard as a rock. Crew apologized and brought a fresh bun. I guess ET assumes all their passengers like spicy food. Ethiopian proud itself on SAFE operation due C19, but on the ground they start boarding before the cabin is ready, so the jetway is packed, passengers on top of each other. Forget Social Distancing. Upon landing in Addis, passengers get up while the aircraft is still taxiing. Cabin crew tried to control the crowds, but to no avail. I forgot my BOSE headphones onboard,but trying to get assistance in the terminal was impossible. I was told “ to find an agent with a radio to call the plane”, but none had a radio. Our flight to Tel Aviv was delayed 3 hours du to some excuses about the ‘Air Space’ being closed in Ethiopia. That didn’t stop other flights to take off. Luckily we left after 3 hours (at 3am rather than 2355) Again that horrible box with spicy chicken, but we were all just happy to be out of Addis Ababa.

2.0,S Berlen,Switzerland,2020-07-19,no hot towel served. No menu,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Addis Abba on 05th July 2020. I had originally booked an economy class seat, but decided to upgrade to Cloud Nine as I wanted to relax and enjoy my flight in comfort.The check-in gentleman in Frankfurt was friendly and processed my $580 upgrade fee. No mention was made about any change in onboard service. I was directed to the Senator lounge at Frankfurt airport where I was horrified to find every single business class passenger flying that evening, attempting to squeeze in the few seats available. If the other lounges in Frankfurt are closed due to Covid-19, then having masses of people cramming into one lounge is a major mistake, as it puts a large number of people crammed together into one small lounge. Rather have several lounges open with a limited restriction on number of guests allowed at a time. Boarding went smoothly.  The seat on the 787 was as expected. Comfortable, but unfortunately that is where the pleasant onboard experience ended. I realise that there may be concerns of the Covid-19 virus and how to handle on-board service, but I had just flown on a Lufthansa connecting flight from Lisbon, and i was given the full Business class experience as normal.  Firstly, no hot towel served. No menu. Inflight entertainment not working.  Seat charging ports not working. Economy class tray and food served in business class. Shocking quality of food for business class. Breakfast was cold and severed in a economy class tray and I found out it was the same meal offered in economy class! Toilet behind seat 5L, not flushing. Crew did not wear gloves at any time during service. How is Ethiopian Airlines charging me a full upgrade cost when the product I am receiving is not business class in any way. Only the seat was business class. Nothing was mentioned about the lack of service onboard this flight. They offer business class as a whole experience and product. I tried to call their global customer service number in Addis Abba and waited for over 6 hours on hold before the calls being cut off! They said they i was ""Next in line"" to be answered for over two hours! each time. It is wrong to use the Covid-19 threat to still charge business class fares but bring down the level and items served in this class.  If you want to cut services offered then you should cut the cost of the business class fares to reflect this.",Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Addis Ababa via Lisbon,2020-07-01,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1,no
7.0,N Ward,Switzerland,2020-07-12,Africa's leading carrier,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ethiopian is an all-around great airline that definitely deserves its status as Africa's leading carrier. For a two hour flight, we even got a full meal, something you'd never get in economy class in the US. They also had a nice cabin with comfortable seats, and there was a new stream to your device entertainment system. However, it's a shame that such a great airline is saddled by such a terrible hub airport like Addis Ababa, which is currently undergoing a renovation that doesn't seem to have changed the problem of congestion and lack of jetbridges. Luckily, this flight departed in the afternoon, as Addis Ababa gets even crazier during the late night hub hours. Boarding was chaotic, which is the norm on Ethiopian, but the arrivals process at NBO was actually decent, as Ethiopian uses Kenya Airways' much more modern wing of the airport for arrivals.

1.0,N Veeran,Switzerland,2020-05-21,unfair with its refund policy,"✅ Trip Verified |  I believe that Ethiopian airline has been very unfair with its refund policy during this corona virus pandemic period. It has advertised that a ""full refund"" will be issued to customers whose intended flight fell between March and June 2020. However, this refund will be in the form of a voucher. This means that the airline has tied up my travel funds and I have no other option but to travel with them when the airports open. The airline has stated that if I want a cash refund, a $300 penalty apply. The airline has refused to issue a cash refund without penalty as it was the airline that went ahead to cancel my flight. They have refused to offset the value of the existing ticket against repatriation costs and I have been backed into a corner where I have no other option but to wait till the airports open (hopefully my visa does not expire before then) and travel with Ethiopian air.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lagos to Toronto via Addis Ababa,2019-06-01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,no

My Wife was in SA when the Lockdown was announced - Virgin summarily cancelled her return flight (am STILL waiting to hear from them re getting back here, even though she has been home for a month) To get back she bought a ticket with Ethiopian Airlines, via Addis Ababa. The flight was great, good service, excellent planes and staff and a pleasant flight all round. Down side was that her suitcase didn't arrive - it wasn't put onto the plane in Johannesburg. Having notified the powers that be at Heathrow - with NO success, I wrote to Ethiopian Airlines directly. Immediate response from the highest level and a string of follow up emails over the next couple of weeks, she received a call yesterday to say that her case was waiting at Heathrow. We went down to collect it immediately - as per normal at Johannesburg International, her wrapped suitcase had been opened, the stitching slit and her case rifled through. Fortunately the low life that got in there didn't find anything as he didn't unzip the top compartment. I have the utmost respect for the way in which Ethiopian Airlines assisted us with the return of the case. Brilliant service.

1.0,Nalini Reddy,Switzerland,2020-03-30,airline was offering a travel voucher,"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and his friend booked tickets to fly from Johannesburg to Chengdu (connecting on to Shenzhen) via Addis Ababa. The departure date was 02 April 2020. South Africa enforced a lockdown from 27 March to 16 April. China enforced a lockdown on 28 March 2020. Despite several attempts to contact the airline locally, we were unsuccessful. Finally after a long, expensive wait, we contacted the call centre in Ethiopia. We were informed that the flight had not been cancelled but as the airline was not allowed to land, there would be no flight. The airline was offering a travel voucher and cancellation with a refund was available with a cancellation fee of USD150 and a no show fee of USD50 with no refund. The difference in airfare would be payable when the voucher was to be used, if applicable. On 27 March we received email notifications for each leg of the flight that the flights were cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. While it is understandable that the airline would not want to lose money, Ethiopian Airlines are using coercion. Customers have no control over changed flight prices at the point of flying after COVID-19. So if one opted for the travel voucher, a customer may have to pay more for a ticket. Should one opt to cancel, the customer would have to pay USD150.  The fair position would be to either refund the customer with no penalties, as it is not the customer’s fault, or to offer the voucher with an assurance that there will be no price difference to be paid later.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Chengdu via Addis Ababa,2020-03-01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,no

I was in transit in Addis and the kids were held back in Bujumbura due to bad weather conditions instead of landing in Kigali as planned, I understand a flight not reaching its destination but I don't understand why the company chose to withhold this information especially from a parent or give me the wrong info altogether, I cannot tell you how much panic this misinformation caused. The ground staff acted like we the clients were bothering them every time we asked for information.

However their pre/after service care that is appalling. Bumped off a flight from Cape Town to London because the previous days flight was overbooked - our flight was overbooked - they put an A350 (smaller seating config) on the route instead of the 777 as had technical issue. Despite having queued for 2.5 hours at check in and the a further four house at the ticket desk, we were whittled off to a hotel for the night and promised to be on the next days plane. Things happen and generally accepted it up to this point. Arrived at airport next day and only ticketed to Addis but promised when we get to Addis would get onward ticket there as they could not issue in CPT. Didn't not believe as need an aisle seat and so was apprehensive. Also informed $300 voucher only usable for a flight or could convert to $150 cash at Heathrow at the ticket desk upon arrival. Got to Addis no onward ticket and when squeezed on the flight told I had to have a middle seat -informed they would ask all passengers on boarding to see if someone would swap.

10.0,S Janovich,Switzerland,2020-02-03,7 flights and fully satisfied,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mekele to Khartoum via Addis Ababa. Total of 7 flights and fully satisfied. During a long trip around Ethiopia we flew Ethiopian 7 times, 6 times on domestic routes and once internationally. Five of those flights were between 40-50 minutes, and even so, we got a snack (pound cake) and a soft drink - if there is any time left you can even ask for a hot coffee. One flight was slightly late, the night before Timkat we were flying to Gondar and it seems that due to huge volume they changed our plane, so there was some confusion at the gate. Furthermore, once on board, there was a technical issue - all in all we were about 2 hrs late taking off, made up half an hour and arrived 1.5 hr late in Gondar. During the waiting time the crew served refreshing drinks and all was calm. The international flight was 1.5 hr long, to Sudan, and once on board the engines were off and there was no A/C, which, however, meant that some nervous passengers started harassing the crew insisting they get them complaint forms during take off! It was quite annoying and unnecessary because once the engines were on the temperature went down so much I needed my jacket. Anyway, some people just like to complain. Every time our bags made it to the airport, even when we had very, very short connections between two Ethiopian flights. During the flight from Lalibela, the plane was waiting for several people who lazily strolled the tarmac to the plane (both Ethiopians and tourists), while the rest of us nervously waited with our short connections in mind. However, at ADD, where we made connections, the second flight waited for us, so we ultimately made it to our final destination, our bags included.

Their Boeing 787 is a great experience, the cabin was good even though they have 2 business class configurations. The one with the rounded seat configuration is better because the seat becomes real flat-bed with plenty foot area, the rectangular seat configuration is not real flat and the leg area is much crowded. Amenities were good and drinks were great. Cabin staff were nice and efficient but they do not kneel to speak to you and sometimes you do not hear what they say. They do not provide pyjamas.

4.0,A Walidale,Switzerland,2020-01-08,plenty of space to stretch out,"✅ Trip Verified |  Booking the flight was convenient and the cost was reasonable considering the time I got my ticket. I have no issue with the flight itself as there were plenty of space to actually stretch out as it wasn't a full flight. My issue is the partnership with Air Cote D'Voire, when I reserved my ticket, I wasn't told I will be needing another ticket for Air Cote D'Voire until I landed in Abidjan. Thankfully I had enough time between my flight. Due to language barrier, the staff that attended to me didnt tell me exactly what the issue was. When I was flying out from Lagos and pressed for time, first of all their Ethiopian airline staff came in late that Saturday morning, and I had to pay extra for an Air Cote D'Voire ticket so I dont miss trip to catch my connecting flight. I reported the issue and wrote plenty of emails and kept getting passed around and till today I got no refund for the new ticket I had to buy even after everyone agreed there was a mistake and I shouldn't have paid for a new ticket.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Abidjan via Lagos,2019-10-01,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3,no

At every point in our trip we were assisted and directed by friendly staff. In addition, we were given hotel vouchers for our Addis Ababa transfer (which we were not expecting) and the transport to and from the airport was effortless.

MCT-ADD return on a 737, the other flights on a Bombardier Q400. All flights left and arrived on time. Cabins simple (no IFE) but functional with reasonably comfortable seats. All four flights were full. Yet the service was friendly and efficient with very decent Ethiopian food and ample drink offerings, including excellent Ethiopian beer and wine. I cannot confirm many of the earlier reviews on this page. All my recent flights with Ethiopian Airlines were good.

Flight was very smooth and landed early, crew was top notch and service is indescribable. Ground staff was great, flight attendant greeted me as I went in and was helpful. All in all, a pleasant flight. In flight entertainment was touchscreen and easy to use, very responsive and the variety of movies is close to Singapore Airlines or Japan Airlines standard.

Ground crew not very knowledgeable, cabin crew not great, uniforms tatty, name tags dirty etc. Addis airport is a dog show. Comparable to a Lusaka bus station.

1.0,Christine Tak,Switzerland,2019-11-19,inability to think critically to fix/solve problems,"Not Verified |  Kigali to Tokyo via Addis Ababa. Terrible airline. I am often forced to fly Ethiopian as I work throughout Africa and there aren't choices for carriers. If anything (anything at all) goes slightly awry relative the original plans (flight delays, bad weather, ticket date change, upgrading), they are absolutely incompetent and unable to to provide any customer service. I've been re-booked on a different flight without notice, only finding out at the airport, and told to go back home. On other occasions, I've had to change the ticket, but had tremendous issues reaching their so-called ""global call centre"", which, despite being '24 hours' often seems to have no one working. Rescheduled/delayed flights often lead to missed connections on other Ethiopian planes, but those later flight-legs are not fixed by the airline, so you're left with a lot of trouble-shooting that you must attempt to do on your own via the '24 hour' call centre. I fly frequently (2-3x per month) for work, but aim to avoid Ethiopian whenever I can, as I know that they will mess something up every third time, and at that stage, it becomes a personal nightmare to fix. Oh, and not to mention that they often lose your luggage, even on business class, and won't deliver the lost luggage to your home once found. Finally, what worries me most is the inability to think critically to fix/solve problems. People within the company don't appear to have the latitude to fix issues that arise (if things don't go exactly as per protocol, then everything breaks down and no one takes initiative). It doesn't make me feel particularly safe when an airline's team members, including senior managers, don't appear to have the latitude to problem-solve in the case of unexpected circumstances.",Business,Business Class,Kigali to Tokyo via Addis Ababa,2019-11-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

I was the first to come for the check-in at the Libreville international airport, and despite producing the ticket, the airline staff said they were unable to find my booking, only that of the children, like how could they lose the main traveler and keep the children? This resulted in a serious waste of time, as they dragged me from office to office, to have this fixed; a problem caused entirely by them! After rebooking my ticket, they then issued me boarding passes for Yaounde, which was not my final destination since I am going to Cape Town, this resulted in another 40-minutes wasted! Then they realise that they did not do the layover booking for us, and they once again had to do it over again. How bad can it get for a single mom travelling with two children? This situation is totally unacceptable for an airline that claims to be the best in Africa! I would never use this airline for travelling ever again!

There is no individual entertainment system, only some tiny shared screens showing kids films.

Flight Attendants are extremely rude and ignore passengers. My experience was they behaved like they were forced to work. Customer service, especially for their local Abuja and Johannesburg offices, do not respond to phone call or emails. Been trying to change a ticket for days no response. Ethiopian website is very terribly user-unfriendly. I don't know if for the purpose of extorting passengers decided to block their manage bookings to prevent passengers from changing the bookings so you rely on their incompetent and ineffective local staff who won't respond to communication.

After noticing that the walker did not arrive to my holiday destination (Sudan), I alerted ET staff in the airport who kept telling me to come back tomorrow which I did over 5 days and receiving a lost luggage report to follow up. It has now been 10 days and I have left my intended holiday destination and returned home to Canada, I called the airline and they told me that I should follow up with the airline in Sudan. I was told their local office is the office in Sudan who will determine whether I will get compensated. Not only did I have to suffer for two weeks without this critical health and safety equipment, the airline completely ruined my vacation and due to their incompetence are asking me to call their Sudan office to ""figure it out"".

The food was inedible. The inflight personnel were unfriendly verging on rude. We were deplaned by bus in Addis. The capper of any trip on Ethiopian is the transit in their brand new airport, which is an appalling shambles. The gold lounge is a joke - it was so crowded, there weren't enough seats for people. The bathrooms inside the lounge (and outside) were small and dirty. It looks like the whole airport doesn't have enough bathrooms. I fly a lot, so I'm a Star Alliance Gold traveller, usually in economy. Ethiopian Airlines is by far the worst airline for star alliance gold travellers to fly.

I decided not to stay there and used my personal Priority Pass membership to go to the Air France/KLM lounge, the lounge Ethiopian used to offer business class passengers. Another thing I thought was odd: Ethiopian wines are no longer available on board (nor in the lounge in Addis).

However, Ethiopian Airlines delayed the flight two days before we are supposed to leave and as a result we can no longer catch the Chinese flight. I then have to speak to the airline and I was on the phone for 40 mins to sort it out. The call centre was helpful but they are incredibly slow. They would tell you to hold and literally disappear for 10 mins while you are holding. After that is sorted, today we are flying and I cannot check in one of the passengers I was travelling with. Remind you that my mother and i bought the ticket at exactly the same time and I checked both of us in online at exactly the same time--however, I cannot check my mother in.

The staff are pretty polite, but we flew from Addis to Sao Paulo with a huge trash bag - transparent - at the staff seat and on landing they fill one bathroom with it. Ethiopian Airlines are the first airline with no pasta choice, just meat or chicken, the food is not good. There is no ice so the beverages and water are at room temperature.

1.0,J Robinson,Switzerland,2019-08-02,deal with their customers better,"Not Verified |  Washington to Kilimanjaro via Addis Ababa. Upon arrival at the airport at 4:30 am, i was notified my connecting flight to Washington Dulles airport had been delayed 5 hours. this would make my connecting international flight to Africa impossible to make. The affiliate airline could not find an alternative on it or any other departure that would make my connection. I called Ethiopian airlines and they did not have any solution. the only resolution was to take the international flight at the same time the next date; however they indicated there were no seats available. My trip was to climb Kilimanjaro, and a 24 hour delay would not permit me to rendezvous with my group of climbers to make the trek. Since they could not offer me a solution that could possibly work, I asked for a refund of my ticket fare and the business class upgrade that i paid for extra. I was on the phone with Ethiopian and their domestic carrier United that day about 2.5 hours, after spending and hour and a half standing in front of the United agent who was not able to help me at all at the airport. I did get some sympathy from the Ethiopian agents but no resolution while on the phone, and they hung up on me twice. In a pickle, I purchased an alternative ticket leaving later that day on another airline (KLM) that would get me to my destination in time to meet my trek guides and other climbers. I notified the airline of my intention to do so, by phone, and then I had to depart to make my trip and the subsequent 28 hours of travel to Kilimanjaro airport. I noticed that I was still being notified of the flights that I was not taking by Ethiopian, but in an effort not to further ruin a lifelong ambition trip, and in consideration of the communication difficulty from my location, i determined I would fight that refund fight after returning. My assistant carried that torch for me during my trip, several times getting on the phone, holding for extreme periods, and then getting disconnected or receiving vague promises to look into it. Upon my return from Africa, we both followed up four more times, but despite getting an eventual promise to refund my tickets, nothing has yet showed up in either an email or a credit (three weeks later). I realize this is complicated by the participation of two airlines (United and Ethiopian) but I purchased my ticket through Ethiopian and United required me to go through them to resolve my dispute. So, i cannot rate Ethiopian on their actual flights, as I did not get to take one, but as for their website and customer service, the website is minimalistic and not up to current e-commerce standards, and the customer service is either over-burdened with issues, or their practice is to try to put customers on hold so long that they eventually give up on their complaint. I had heard good reports on Ethiopian from travelers flying regularly to Africa prior to this, and several of my companions were on the flight that I missed (they flew in to Washington the night before) and they had not complaints.

Airplanes might be new or recent but seem centuries old when inside. Flight from ASM to ADD was on an old B767-300 with overhead compartments not closing properly, and half the seats unfit for air travel (seats that do not recline, no belts). The fact that Ethiopian doesn’t seem to care is beyond understanding but Eritrean aviation authorities should check the aircrafts and ground them if they keep treating customers and safety like this. Transiting through Addis is a nightmare (airport stuck in time, few dining and drinking options, not enough seats within the transit area, smoking area that is disgusting, employees literaly force you to reach your gate even if your flight is in two hours and there is nothing around boarding gates). The fact that the airline is monopolistic on so many routes sure doesn’t help them improve their standards.

The aircraft looked very poorly maintained even though they were not that old (less than 10 years old). The cabin crew were nice overall but looked junior. They did not close all the overhead lockers on both flights, prompting a few passengers to do it themselves.  I found the food  quite bad, a shame considering Ethiopia's culinary heritage.

I was handed out a drink from the cabin crew, and that was the only service provided. The seat was comfortable, but wasn't well maintained. The case of my PTV was hanging lose, so I wasn't able to use the on-off button, so I couldn't use the IFE at all. Also, the touch screen wasn't working.

1.0,Benjamin Demming,Switzerland,2019-05-31,experience absolutely dreadful,"✅ Trip Verified |  On March 21st, my girlfriend and I went to buy tickets from Cairo to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian airlines website. The first time we went to buy a ticket the card was declined. We went back to try to buy the ticket again with the same card. This time it took us an hour just to fill out information as our names kept being changed, altered, distorted, and deleted. Eventually to find out, the date was changed too. When we went to pay for those tickets, the card was declined again. We went through the whole process again of names being changed and deleted and finally paid for those tickets with a different card. That transaction was declined as well. We contacted this exact email address for help that day and there was no response ever. 2 days later we received a confirmation that tickets had been bought. I had to cancel the order on the second credit card so that we would not be charged for two purchases. Why is a purchase being made from our credit cards after the website has reportedly declined our credit cards and ceased the transaction. On April 20th I look at the tickets and the tickets were issued for Jul 22nd and not April 22nd. I had spent 3 hours being sent from person to person on phone only to be charged an extra $170 to get our tickets changed to April 22nd on a flight with many open seats, as that is how much more they cost on April 20th rather than on March 21st when I initially bought the tickets, for a problem caused by the horrific user interface set up by Ethiopian airlines and their lack of customer support. This experience with Ethiopian airlines has been absolutely dreadful and by far the worst experience of them all. Ethiopian Airlines has provided terrible care for their customers and all I have been given is one email as their appears to be no person qualified to talk to and provide us the care that should be provided.

Outbound an old B737 with ancient cradle seats that made sleeping difficult on this night flight. Below standard Business Class product which was somewhat rescued by the very friendly and attentive staff and the excellent food. The return started with an annoyance: we arrived at the airport, again at night, only to learn that our return flight was canceled, reportedly because there were not enough passengers. It must have been a spontaneous decision by Ethiopian since the flight was still displayed on the departure screens. The ground staff was more than nonchalant: “We didn’t call or text you? Oh sorry. Come back tomorrow.” My wife almost lost her composure since we both had to work the next day. With the help of the terminal 1 station manager, we finally managed to be rerouted through Dubai and reached Muscat some six hours later than expected. Muscat to Dubai was on a new A350 with excellent full-flat seats and again excellent food and service.

Friends used to ask me why use ET when your in East Africa and going to another East African country or going to another place where you can easily connect. All l could say l like the service and it doesn't matter if l have to go all the way to Addis. This time coming from Cape Town we had only 10mins to connect and for the first time I was 100% sure I would get to Entebbe without my luggage. I don't know how they made it or how they did it we all had our bags and we couldn't believe it how fast they transferred our bags to the flight to Entebbe. We were so happy and overjoyed. Have never missed my luggage or neither have anything stolen .

6.0,P Heale,Oman,2019-03-21,food was a pleasant surprise,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. I was on a 787 which was a continuation of a flight from Addis Ababa. Check in was not good. I was the first in line in the Star Gold line, and there were three open desks. But none of the staff appeared to be working. The one desk which was processing customers was dealing with someone who was clearly a difficult customer, and wouldn't be finished any time soon. Since I had only carry on luggage and had checked in online, I decided to skip the counter and verify my documents at the gate. No problem there. The plane was nearly empty--maybe 40 guests on a 787. We all got rows to ourselves. We boarded on time, but left a little bit late. The seats were worn out, this must have been one of the oldest 787s in the fleet. The entertainment system was also a bit beat up, but the selection of both international and African films was surprisingly good. The food was also a pleasant surprise, delivered quickly, tasty and hot. The inflight team had a way to go to live up to international standards. They seemed to be barely able to hide their contempt for their passengers, which seemed strange. But you could see where some of that was coming from, there appeared to be a training attendant who was constantly criticizing them, her face never broke from an angry scowl. I wouldn't not fly them again. But as long as there are other choices, I'd probably look elsewhere.",Business,Economy Class,Bangkok to Hong Kong,2019-03-01,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4,yes

In contrast food service was poor. I have flow Ethiopian from IAD to ADD numerous times and always raved and appreciated their food service. We were fed at least four times and always bragged about it. However, on this particular flight we were fed only twice. Had Ethiopian had this policy from the get go nobody would have complained, i guess they spoiled us.

10.0,Aiyaphol Kemapuckpong,Oman,2019-03-06,a world class airline,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ethiopian airlines is a world class airline, comparable to Emirates. Plus, they’re half the price of Emirates. I recently flew ultra-long haul 23 hours each way from Bangkok to Buenos Aires and returning from Newark. Both flights had two stops for crew changes. Check in at Bangkok Airport seems disorganised and the location of the check in counters which are next to El Al means you are checking in next to armed security personnel which gives an uncomfortable feeling. My hopes went up when I visited the EVA Air lounge which was very good. Boarding was extremely disorganised, they shouted out business class passengers but I was blocked by other passengers from entering the gate. We had the older business class product which is similar to Turkish Airlines A330, but compressed into a smaller cabin. You had a choice of mimosa, champagne or orange juice on boarding, and the cabin was 50-75% full on all flights. After a late night departure, only three passengers chose to have dinner, so there was no excuse for slow service. Within an hour after takeoff, I had enjoyed a very good late night meal. They plate the food on board the aircraft and place individual elements on the tray table, rather than bringing it out on a tray. After which, I slept like a baby on their comfortable seat. A comfortable quilt is provided, business class quality, but the pillow is too small. Transfer in Addis Ababa is messy, but you manage to get through somehow. The cloud nine lounge is one of the most unique I have ever experienced, and instead of doing an ear-wrenching PA a lounge attendant walks around shouting different destinations which are ready for boarding. I felt this was acceptable as they didn’t want people missing their flights. I thoroughly enjoyed a six-course meal on the flight to São Paulo, including some local dishes. One thing they do right on Ethiopian is every chicken dish I’ve had has always been moist and not dried out. Great job on that! The crew were courteous and well-trained. They were more than willing to go the extra mile. There were Enough movies to keep me entertained for all flights. The return from Newark just proved to me they are better than Emirates. The flight was delayed due to weather and late arrival, so when they announced the delay I asked if I could wait in the business class lounge. The gate agent said she would pick us up and whisk us through when the flight was ready to board. Sure enough, 30 minutes later, the gate agent comes and sees me and whisks me and other business class passengers through a very crowded boarding area. The flight was delayed three hours due to de-icing and weather, and by the time we got to Addis Ababa, we literally had five minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave. No problem, they whisked all tight connections onto a bus and drove us straight to the plane, and I was literally the last passenger to board the plane. All these little details clearly make Ethiopian Airlines a world class airline. When I re-read their website, they define their cloud nine as “a mix between first and business class.” I can very clearly see elements in the soft product which accounts for first class service. The hard product is still business class, to be fair. I would have no hesitation in flying Ethiopian again at all.",Family Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Buenos Aires via Addis Ababa / Sao Paulo,2019-03-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes

I am shocked how unprofessional the staff was. I and my two friends were also told by the same people that we can not get on the plane if we keep questioning them about her window seat.

6.0,B Barsten,Oman,2019-02-03,generally positive experience,"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Cape Town via Addis Ababa . Both flights were on time and cabin crew were friendly and helpful throughout. I chose Ethiopian based on routing and overall point to point travel time. I was a bit concerned, because my connecting time in Addis was just over one hour - tighter than I think I could do at any European airport. But Ethiopian managed this with flying colors! Not only that, the overall comfort level on the planes (787 and 777) was quite acceptable, better, I think, than what I would expect on an American carrier (though lower than on, say, Emirates). The aircraft inbound to Addis from Madrid wasn't as clean as it should have been (and the toilet paper ran out in one bathroom). The aircraft outbound from Addis was properly cleaned (probably they do that kind of servicing only in the home airport), though the food on that leg was substandard (worst dessert I've ever tasted, but I would consider that a small fault). I should note that the new terminal in Addis wasn't completely ready and it was literally impossible to get information on my connecting flight's departure gate from the monitors. In the end, I trusted my Madrid-printed boarding pass, which did the trick. Verdict: not top of the heap, but my first experience on Ethiopian was a generally positive experience. In fact, I've booked another trip from Europe to South Africa with them for later in the year.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Cape Town via Addis Ababa,2018-12-01,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4,yes

4.0,K Thorne,Oman,2019-01-24,definitely not recommend,"✅ Trip Verified | Addis Ababa to London Heathrow. Found the entire on-the-ground experience in Addis to be a nightmare. Four really lengthy queues: security to get into terminal, passport control, gate security and then, finally and most unnecessary, a huge queue to check your boarding pass and passport at the gate. This was being done (extremely slowly) by a single (sometimes two) Ethiopian Airlines employee while a selection of her colleagues just watched. Seats themselves are fine, and the inflight entertainment was decent - good screen and a reasonable selection to choose from. However, the food was atrocious, definitely the worst food i've ever had on a long-haul flight. Dinner was a ""chicken"" sandwich with a plain cous cous side dish. The ""chicken"" was some form of luncheon meat, with a pink colour and a horrible flavour. Breakfast was a bland hot dish of ""sausage"" and scrambled eggs with some foul tinned-style fruit (not fresh). The cabin crew were for the most part ok, but there was an incident with a child vomiting across the aisle from me. Despite me alerting the crew, all they did was provide the mother with napkins to clean up and made no effort to clean the vomit from the carpet and back of the seat themselves. As a result the cabin smelt like vomit for the rest of the flight. Would definitely not recommend - there are better options for this journey, even if it involves a layover.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to London Heathrow,2019-01-01,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3,no

7.0,Anders Pedersen,Oman,2019-01-05,last trip much more pleasurable,"✅ Trip Verified | Travelled from FRA to KGL via ADD and BJM on 3-4 January 2019 on A350-900 for the first time – and 737 on the regional flights. Check-in in FRA was not easy, neither on line nor in Airport and I got a bad seat in the middle of a middle section 1 row away from the rear toilets – sat in 46 F. However, they granted me space of two seats as 1 passenger did not show up. Flight full and almost on time. In Addis, bus gating from remote stand took >50 Minutes to disembark the aircraft as they only provided disembarking from a single door in front. Furthermore, they provided only a single bus at a time for 300+ passengers. In FRA they failed to print out my second BP, this often happens with ET and is very annoying as one has to queue up again in Addis to get the second. In ADD, I went to Cloud Nine Lounge though I am at present ineligible without elite status and on economy ticket. However, the lounge reception were kind and let me in meanwhile they upgraded from economy to business for 15,000 miles for next leg to KGL over BJM. Cloud Nine Lounge was nice, X-mas decorations and only half full. The last trip became much more pleasurable and peaceful than the first one though on a much smaller, modest aircraft.

1.0,S Phabena,Oman,2019-01-03,such poor service,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg return via Addis return. I was unable to use the self check in service at home or at Heathrow Airport. It took 45 minutes to check in at Heathrow even though they were only two people ahead of me. They were there making enquiries about flights. I was allocated a middle seat next to the toilets, and I was sitting between two large men. The plane was over booked and some passengers sat with the flight attendants, they were very noisy and were chatting in loud voices with the attendants through out the journey. For the evening meal I was served a tiny roll with melted butter and a filling which was supposedly chicken and a cup of coffee. I was never asked to choose. I do not eat chicken or drink coffee. The flight attendants were not attentive and were very selective in the manner they treated passengers. I was not offered a blanket even though I asked for one several times. On my return I came via Addis on the 25th and arriving at Bole on the 26th of Nov at 5am. On arrival I noticed that I had left my residence card in Johannesburg when I tried to board the flight to London. The check in flight attendant ceased my passport, boarding pass and my baggage stickers. She left me seated at the departure lounge departure lounge until the plane had left. She did not explain what was to happen next but she refused to hand back any of my documents. After two hours she said I must go to the Interlink Desk down stairs and that she would meet me there. I waited for her at the Interlink desk and she never showed up, the staff were not aware of what was happening. They only came to know about my case late afternoon, even then no one could update me or tell me about what was happening. They Interlink staff said they had received my documents from check-in-attendant but they were not going to release my documents. I asked if I could fly back to Johannesburg to try and retrieve my missing document, but I was told I was not allowed to. I spent the day and half the at the airport being ignored.  On the 26th late afternoon I was told I was booked on a flight back to Johannesburg. I asked about my luggage and was told the luggage 42kg had been sent to Johannesburg. The staff in Bole refused to hand over my passport but gave it to the flight attendants. When I arrived in Johannesburg I was escorted by two immigration staff off the flight. The immigration staff in Johannesburg handed me back my documents and let me go. I checked for my luggage at the Ethiopian desk, the staff there were not helpful they refused to note that my luggage was missing and advised me to check for it in Heathrow. I booked a direct flight with another airline and I tried to trace my luggage in Heathrow it had not arrived. I luggage remains missing, I have tried to make contact with Ethiopian Airlines in UK through the numbers provided on website and by writing emails to different offices both in UK and Addis both my emails and phone calls have not been answered. I have made several trips to Heathrow trying to make contact and I have been made aware that the desk is only open between 14.15 to 19.15.

But a lovely lady went above and beyond to check is in with another seat next to us to allow for the extra room that family seating would have allowed. Wow this member of staff went above and beyond and started our journey on a good note. Our flight was long with an arduous stop in Zambia, Addis, then Dublin, but the staff were warm, friendly and went the extra mile. They were lovely and made the incredibly long flight manageable.

It was fish with lots of cabbage with cabbage pickle. However, The rest was fairly fine. The newly renovated airport in Addis Ababa is partially opened adding extra seats and comfort.

So, if nothing goes wrong, you have the chance to have a very pleasant flight. When the slightest problems arise, you will suffer.

No transport was provided, nor alternative flights to Vienna where the flight ADD was still departing. Paris-Addis flight we were downgraded.

I had a flight going from Addis Ababa to Paris, guy on the counter told me there was a “change in aircraft” & issued me a “standby ticket” but told me there was nothing wrong & seat would be assigned at gate. My baggage was checked, I then proceeded to do security, and asked two more people, told me there was “nothing wrong”, I did the line, waited to hop on the plane, me together with other 5 were on standby. They told me the flight was full, if there was any seat they’d give it to me - they didn’t, instead, they gave it to the other guys that arrived later. I stayed there shocked, and waited & waited, they told me they were going to put me on plane to another city in Europe and then connect me to Paris and issued a ticket for me to go to Geneva - so after one very stressful hour, took me to the office so they’d re-issue a ticket for the next flight (which was in 24 hours) and give me an economic compensation at this point, information was never clear and all agents seemed unprepared. I arrived to the office to find out my “compensation” was 200 dollars for a mistake they did agent again acted rude. They issued me a boarding pass with assigned flight for the next day and gave me a paper to “cash in” the money in “any ticket office of Ethiopian Airlines” literal words from the agent. Next day I came to the Airport, to cash in my money - surprise, they “couldn’t cash money at airport” “they didn’t have dollars” “supervisor couldnt sign the release paper” were some of the various excuses they gave me. They told me to pick up the money at the Hilton Hotel in the city 30 min drive from the airport. I arrived at the hotel, and they didn't have dollars, so....they told me they were going to “try to get the money”. Told me to give them my number and they will call me with a “solution”. I went away, and at 3:50pm they called me to tell me they had the money, that I had until 5pm to get there (another 30-40 minute drive) and get it - rudeness again was present They told me I couldn’t get it at the airport, since no supervisor was available to give me the money, going to the hotel was mandatory. I picked up the ridiculous 200USD, and thought this was the final chapter of this bad Ethiopian movie. I get on the plane the next day at 11:30 pm Sunday (after spending one day in Addis) battling with Ethiopian Airlines, get on the plane, get seated on my seat and another woman with a baby and I had he same  seats assigned, and a very rude Ethiopian Airlines agent demanded I moved, since the woman had also this seat.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Paris,2018-11-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

I have been following up with ET several times with regards to a claim on a damaged bag and unfortunately have been shoved from pillar to post with a no care attitude! All I wanted was for someone at ET was to give me legitimate up to date feedback on what was happening with this damaged bag claim. But since 21 Feb 2018 I have only received useless emails whereby staff have been pushing the responses to different departments with no luck. I even went as far as starting a fresh mail chain hoping this would get a different response but  no difference in customer support!

In MSA they didnt give me the second boarding pass from ADD to YYZ saying their system was down and I would get it in ADD. On arriving in ADD, I was directed to customer service who upon checking my passport and permanent residence card (PR) said that they need to verify with the embassy and i should have a seat as i wait. 45 minutes later (while the lady assisted all other passengers) I stood up to ask her what was going on. She then gave me back my documents without any explanation and asked me to proceed to the gate. At the gate I explained I didnt have a boarding pass and another lady asked me to seat so that she can process my documents. 2 hrs later,and after the call to board I stood up to ask them what was going on. The lady referred me to another person who then told me their system was down. After pleading that I would miss my flight I was given a boarding pass with a different seat number almost at the end. At first I sat patiently both times as I thought maybe something was wrong with my documents. Turns out it was their system all along and instead of communicating with me they were just indifferent to my plight. I wouldn't recommend this airline to any of my friends after what i went through.

1.0,Hadas Ohayon,Oman,2018-10-08,customer service the poorest,"✅ Trip Verified |  Buenos Aires to Tel Aviv via Addis Ababa. The customer service was the poorest! First, they charged me $300 more than what it shoes on their app - when I called customer service I had to wait more than 40 minutes to get to a representative that hardly spoke English and told me to Email them. When I did, they responded more than a week later saying the currency exchange was wrong and I was charged in Argentinian pesos and not in the local Ethiopian currency. At some point, they stopped responding to my emails. When I got to Tel Aviv I found out that my belongings in the checked suitcase were broken. I took pictures and sent it to the airline support email, I could only send one picture at the time. Although I sent several Email, I did not get a single response.  On the day of the flight, I had 19 hours connection stop in Ethiopia, according to their policy I was supposed to get a night in a hotel, at their expense, which I was supposed to get during the check-in. The lady at the kiosk in Tel Aviv was so rude and kept me waiting till the 15 minutes before boarding, saying I could have booked a later flight and avoid the wait, therefore I'm not entitled to an overnight stay on their expense. Needless to say that when I booked the flight there was no such option (to avoid the wait with a shorter connection). After waiting for her to contact the whole airport, and texting a couple of private friends that had nothing to do with my flight, she told me I have 15 minutes to get to the gate or I will lose my flight. At the gate, I spoke with the ""supervisor"" who told me I should speak to the airline rep in Ethiopia, when I get there. She also screamed at me, saying its my fault for not choosing shorter connection time, even though I explained to her that I was never given the option. The rep's desk in Ethiopia didn't help much as well, but at the very least they were nice enough to plain to me that the kiosk in Tel Aviv could put me on a later flight that same night and shorten my connection to 4.5 hours. They explained that ""they should have done it"" or at least offer me that option since that flight was almost empty. I had to spend 19 hours at the not-so-traveler friendly airport in Addis Ababa.

They changed our departure date to two days later and did not email us to tell us about the change. We only found out the day we were supposed to fly by checking the details on a separate online site. I talked to three supervisors and was not able to get an earlier flight, a compensation, or a bump to business class. We nearly missed a wedding and lost money on pre-booked accommodation and buses. They just kept insisting that the system is supposed to send an email. They also did not give us our pre-requested vegetarian meal option. They only had meat and could not give me a main course. Finally they found one vegetarian left and split it between all the people who did not have their requested meal. She kept insisting that we were not on the list for requested meals. A boy was vomiting on the plane and the attendants did not come when we used the button to call them. Nor did they come later when I needed a customs form. My seat could not fully recline and my onboard entertainment system was broken. This whole experience was awful, I told the employees that if they could not do anything to help the situation, either by booking an earlier flight, providing partial or full compensation, or giving us some sort of bump for the lost time and money that we encountered due to their mistake, that I would never fly with them again and would never recommend them.

The staff at Addis Ababa airport speak in one word sentences and often bark instructions at people.  10 days ago I spent 3 and half hours in a queue for a hotel voucher. The staff were rude and unhelpful. When we arrived at the shabby hotel we were offered over cooked food. On my way back to Cape Town today I was forced to stay a night in another hotel.

It took them another 3 to 4 hours to find the luggage. I went myself into the storage rooms and looked for the luggage. Upon complaint of this there was no response from the ground staff. Next day when we went to catch our onward flight to Seychelles, we were told that we will be detained here as we do not have yellow cards. This was not asked from any other passengers as we all were on transit visa.

Both flights delayed. Arrived in KRT 5 hours late (with Fydubai from DXB) due to closure of the airport. KRT airport had a crash and the lanes were blocked 4 hours in the morning. Had to accept No-Show and rebooking fee to ET just outside the airport. Had no visa but transit passed relatively smoothly with a lot of officers leading and attending me while retaining my passport. A humiliating experience but I know these things eventually works out well – just don’t be fuzzy. Ticket reissue went very fast, paid 100 USD cash. Both Boarding passes received in KRT which proved crucially necessary: flight became 45 Min. delayed. Bus-gatings from/to terminals throughout, very tiresome: I waited in KRT >30 Minutes with 80 passengers in a double-bus before it took-off to the aircraft 200 meters away. Transit in ADD was horrible due to hundreds of people waiting and blocking security check. Manage in last Minute to board an old 737-700 to Kigali. However, after boarding delayed >1 hour on tarmac due to “gas refuelling” discovered though the captains’ recalculation of amount needed.

The worst, the booking clerk issued boarding pass till Addis Ababa and told me to collect boarding pass of Dubai at Addis Ababa. I believed and it was my biggest mistake. Now I came to Addis Ababa and after continuous follow up with the person concern i could not get boarding pass. They asked me to wait for some time and checked 80% passenger and then declared flight is full and next flight is in morning. It is to be noted that my flight was at 9.35 pm from Addis Ababa which got delayed to 1 am and after it was declared full, next flight announced was at 10.00 am in morning. There were around 25 passenger stranded without their fault in fact it was fault of Ethiopian airlines. After a lot of fight, struggle and waiting at 3 am new ticket is issued and we are left at low class lounge at our mercy to wait till 9.45 pm - promised to provide hotel but it is certain no such facility will be given because there are more than 500 people stranded for different flight because of overbooking and nobody is there to console or give appropriate reply.",Business,Economy Class,Blantyre to Dubai via Addis Ababa,2018-08-01,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no

We had informed the flight attendant about the issue twice but didn't notice any action from her on this issue. Also, the flight was delayed by about 90 minutes. We had to wait from about 9:30 PM (Addis Time) in the night or 12:00 AM Indian time to 9:00 AM Indian time and all that was provided was a meal by the airlines. The snack service was not repeated. Given that there is no provision for food in the Addis Ababa airport after the security check is completed, this is a very long time that the airline would be hosting the guests and should plan accordingly for delay in flights.

1.0,C Deane,Oman,2018-08-10,8 Hours on the phone,"✅ Trip Verified |  The actual experience of flying with Ethiopian is OK. Nothing special, not really on par with the transatlantic coach flights to and from Europe, but pretty standard quality of food and service that I have come to expect from flights to and from Africa. However, a colleague had a medical emergency so I had to extend my trip, which meant I had to rebook my returning ticket. I cannot express to you the horror of that experience. Despite the fact that I was more than willing to pay whatever necessary change fees and rate differences, it took me a total of 8 Hours on the phone with them to rebook. They do not allow rebooking online, which meant that I had to spend an entire day on hold with various people, which is not easy (or Cheap) from a remote part of Ghana with little cell service. Every time I would get through the hold line and speak with a representative, they would figure out a flight for me, then ""transfer"" me to their sales department, and I would be hung up on. Or I would be on hold for an hour Then hung up on. After the complete mess that was finally getting this sorted out was finished, After 8 hours of this nonsense, they tell me that I cannot be confirmed for the rebook yet because I had to pay the change fees first, In Person In Cash. What airline in 2018 doesn't accept online payments, card payments over the phone, or even wired money? Of course, I was in rural Ghana, which meant I couldn't spend 3 days traveling from there to their head office in the capital to pay this change fee when the entire point was that I was unable to travel to Accra at that time for my original flight. After 2 weeks of fighting with them over the phone about this, Finally one of the local agents tells me I can pay the money into their bank account in a city nearby my location (who knows Why no one ever gave me that option previously!?). I was very worried this would turn out to be a scam because it was a pretty sketchy set up, but it worked out in the end.

Always greedy after money and this time they wanted to charge me 35 USD because I was “2 hours early”. This, despite I had Lounge Invitation printed on my BPs. I had to call ET-manager to access. The lounge is so, so, but they have plenty hot snacks and drinks. Aircraft B787-900 on 1st leg was downgraded to a smaller B737 due to low load in economy. However, that caused 3 biz-passengers to be downgraded. Without being requested, I volunteered to do so and got 250 USD in ET-vouchers as compensation. The check-in staff came to the lounge and were relieved by my decision. I was fine as I still had my special meal and lounge access. I was treated like a king to Addis: despite travelling economy I almost felt ashamed getting champagne and foods from bz-class brought down discretely to row 17. I even got my special meal (red-snapper) but had to additional dishes, veal and beef, all very tasty. Got the menu from business could choose food and drinks from there. Only downturn was the plastic cutlery. They gave me 3 seats for myself despite economy became 75% full. Cloud Nine Lounge in Addis was OK but no showers neither there not in any other lounge in Addis. Tried to cash my vouchers but failed. Both flights almost on time.

FAs are kind but much less professional than for Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines. Special meal accommodated. IFE excellent. The airport in Addis needs expansion and tends to be very crowded and messy. Lounges in Addis were full, though with good food and Wi-Fi. Smokers area like a pig-stall. Gate for second flight changed 3 times, including flight number. Poor signage and information at most gates made frustrated and panicking passengers.

1.0,Steve Hansen,Oman,2018-07-11,Ethiopian Airlines customer review,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Nairobi via Addis Adaba. I was hesitant to book with Ethiopian airlines, however the schedule suited us. We flew from Johannesburg to Nairobi with a stop over in Addis Adaba. Firstly our plane was delayed by a couple of hours in Addis Adaba which is no big deal however we were ushered into a gate that was a construction zone through security where we had to wait. There was no air conditioning and the drinking water tanks were all empty. When we finally got on the plane I had to ask 5 times for some water for my children. I had pre selected our seats and was told that due to traveling with children we could not sit in the selected seats as it was an exit row. So they reallocated our seats and we were not sitting with our 5 and 7 year old children. I argued that I was not willing to allow my young children to sit next to strangers. I was told that I had to swap myself with other passengers when I boarded the plane. Luckily the other passengers allowed us to sit together. No thanks to Ethiopian Airlines. I also noticed after boarding that our original allocated seats were NOT in an exit row. When we arrived at Nairobi 2 of our bags were missing. After spending over an hour filling out paperwork at the airport we finally got to leave without the 2 bags. After 3 days of having no clothes mosquito spray and toiletries which we had to purchase ourselves again, our bags were located and my safari company picked the bags up for us. When we received the bags they were both badly broken. I spoke to the manager when we returned to the airport and was told there was nothing she could do and we should speak to the manager when we arrive back to Johannesburg. I spoke to somebody at the desk in Johannesburg and he gave me more paperwork and was told somebody would contact me. It has now been 3 weeks and after I have sent many emails, messages etc I still haven’t heard back from the airline.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Nairobi via Addis Adaba,2018-06-01,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,1,no

Was not clear on booking they flights 2+3 was a stopover rather than a transfer which was nice except it led to ticketing confusion which annoyed their staff. Food was acceptable but ran out of options halfway. Great range of meal choices offered on the website. I picked a Hindi meal. These were not offered on any flights - only chicken or beef.

9.0,Anders Pedersen,Oman,2018-06-09,one of my best economy flights,"✅ Trip Verified |  Transited in Addis on my way to Khartoum on 8th June 2018. The airport (T2) is overcrowded, messy, and queues everywhere. Boarding tedious and waiting for ½-1 hour for the bus in overcrowded narrow room at Gate 13. We became >½ hours late departing, but as the plane was full it was almost excusable. As the pax-load was full and the aircraft was a smaller B737-800 they were seizing and checking in hand-luggage for a lot of overloaded passengers, inclusive of myself. I argued that I need to go with my hand-luggage as I was only transiting in KRT and could not retrieve it easily without a visa to Sudan. After some discussion they eventually allowed my two pieces to pass to be taken on board. On board I had one of my best economy flights for years: FAs were fit, well rested, effective, focused, and kind and expedite. Despite the flight was full and the duration were only 1½-2 hours, everything worked to perfection. Two hot meals offered, I chose a fish steak for breakfast. It was so good I had to inquire for one additional. Voila, in 6-8 seconds after I told this to the FA it was on my plate. Drinks offered were plenty including wine and beers. The brands were well selected and tasted very well for economy class. The FAs came around and asked if there were other requests they could assist with. They served us until we landed and there were no stops in service from kick-off till landing. They were so well groomed, professional, and neat. IFE were missing apart from radio/music access. The aircraft appeared new and in good condition despite being an old model. At arrival, two stairways were put up allowing for quick disembarking being taken by bus to the arrival area and then confronted with the harsh Sudanese immigration where huge patience is the strongest weapon to overcome the hurdles.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Khartoum,2018-06-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5,yes

Upgraded successfully from economy class by putting my modest bid through their homepage. Check-in was very lengthy as they could not issue the second boarding pass when I was upgraded on the first sector. I could not accept it and stood at the counter almost ½ hour before the second BP came out. Worth waiting for compared to waiting at a transfer counter in ADD to get it. It eventually went through and I then enjoyed the lounge access in KGL and good service on board in the four rows of business class (cabin ½ full). I was disappointed they only served breakfast as I needed dinner. But I spotted from the menu card the dinner served on the incoming flight. I then managed to secure my favourite dinner from that menu, despite it was not on offer and a few hours old, but reheated. Pre-departure champagne brut (“Lallier”) was fine. FAs attentive.

I now frequently use Ethiopian on trips from Bangkok to Africa as they provide a good business class at reasonable prices and extremely good connections, with relatively short transfer times in Addis. Food is generally quite good on Ethiopian, local wines excellent and service attentive. On my last flight (ET618), instead of the now usual Dreamliner, Ethiopian used an older B767, with a very limited entertainment system, as they only showed African, Asian, Hindi and 4 European movies and no blockbusters or US movies; also, immigration forms were not available, but otherwise, a very pleasant flight.",Business,Business Class,Abidjan to Bangkok via Addis Ababa,2018-06-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5,yes
7.0,Etoile Mellor,Oman,2018-05-28,FAs excellent and attentive,"❌ Not Verified |  Addis Ababa to Stockholm. Flights to Cape Town from Stockholm are thin on the ground. You can either choose the major European carriers such as BA, KLM's daylight service or AF (all of which are about €800) or use Emirates or Qatar and make do with the long flights through the Middles East. I decided to use Ethiopian Airlines which was the most cost effective and fastest service (< 2 hours connection times in both directions) Although 3 out of 4 legs were in economy, I'm going to review the business class service which I won through a reverse auction. As a self employed person, the only other 787 business I have flown is Qatar Airways 1-2-1 product. Ethiopian uses a 2-2-2. This means that there is a distinct advantage of taking one of the center seats where both you and your neighbor have direct aisle access. That being said, I really didn't notice the smaller seat width as the proof of the pudding is in the sweat pitch. FAs were excellent and attentive (as good as the Middle East airlines). Food seemed good (though not brilliant) as I took a night flight and just had water and tea. IFE was excellent in terms of screen size and choices. Bed was almost flat but long enough to sleep for most of the flight. Only downside was having one toilet for the whole cabin compared to Qatar which has two for only 20 seats. Lastly, for all the bad press that Bole airport has, whilst it wasn't a dream, it was no worse than I've been to in other parts of Europe for sheer chaos. I wouldn't like to spend 8 hours there. The most worrying aspect was the runway setup which meant that both landing and departing aircraft had to taxi across the runway to get to the gates or line up for take off. A little investment at the East and West entry points could solve this relatively easy.",Business,Business Class,Addis Ababa to Stockholm,2018-05-01,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes
5.0,David Taylor,Oman,2018-05-28,without charm but efficient,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Blantyre via Addis Ababa. Outbound from Heathrow to Addis on A350 on time and full. Seat room better than most airlines. Food was ordinary and cabin crew efficient. Addis Ababa to Blantyre Malawi - old and quite tatty Boeing 737-800. Plane full and left on time en route to Lilongwe and then finally to Malawi. Flight of 5 hrs plus and no in flight entertainment-drop down screens did not work. Addis Ababa to Lilongwe leg-passenger became ill on route - a medical emergency due to diabetic seizure. Luckily two doctors on board, and the female doctor and the cabin crew administered a drip and patient recovered. Full praise to the doctor and cabin crew who had the necessary first aid kit and were calm and efficient throughout. We were not diverted. Eventually arrived in Blantyre on time - you are not allowed off the aircraft at Lilongwe if in transit. Return leg- Blantyre to Addis Ababa Boeing 737-800 - this was a newer cleaner aircraft. Meal was served which was reasonable but the passenger behind me had a beef stew which was cold and had to be replaced. Addis to London an A350- a newer aircraft, comfortable seats. Configuration a little strange - very large galley area and a large space near emergency doors at rear of the aircraft. I hope they leave this space as it is and not add extra seats. Flight was over 7 hours and they served a snack instead of an evening meal - a dry ""chicken roll"" which has nearly no filling and was very poor followed by a cereal bar. Before landing there was a ""breakfast"" which was egg, potato and a synthetic thing called a sausage. This was probably the worst breakfast I have tried to eat in many years of flying and I had to leave most of it. Plane was on time. Cabin crew were without charm but were efficient.

3.0,P Kapotek,Oman,2018-05-20,seats  must have been 17 years old,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mekele to Dakar via Addis Ababa. The short flight from Mekele to Addis Ababa was on B737 with good regional business class but very low quality snack was served. On arrival all business class passengers got into minivan, only I was told to take economy class bus as minivan is only for VIP passengers. Older business class lounge in Addis Ababa but fine for 2 hours and with quite good breakfast selection. When I did web checking I noticed that originaly scheduled B787 was switched to B767. I was not alarmed as all Boeing 767 were supposed to be refurbished with lie flat beds. So I was shocked when I boarded to see recliner seats which must have been 17 years old. The seat would be ok for short regional flight but not for 10 hours I spent on the plane (there was technical stop in Bamako). On seat under the pillow and blanket there was left lots of rubbish from previous flights. Only overhead monitors were available and these were so low quality and dark that it was impossible to watch anything. Crew was just OK. They did what they were supposed to do but not very friendly. Food was edible, with the exception of Ethiopian dish which was excellent (you get both western and Ethiopian dish) and it is good that they serve it from trolley, otherwise I would have difficulties to know what to choose. In future if I could be guaranteed that flight would be operated with A350 or B787 and ticket price would be good, I wouldn’t have problem flying Ethiopian again. But knowing that the planes can be switched to this kind of inferior product, I would not fly again with them. When I was leaving Dakar (fortunately on other airline) there was Ethiopian Boeing 737 at airport. I am not sure if it was originally scheduled airplane or there was aircraft change, but this B737 would be even worse for length of this flight than the B767.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mekele to Dakar via Addis Ababa,2018-03-01,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,no

Addis Ababa airport very old and quite dirty, not enough seating considering it’s one of the main points for transferring passengers to the rest of world. A lot of the same shops not a good variety or choices. Not a lot of food shops, a lot of souvenir shops and very expensive too. Plane service from staff bad, I don’t know if it’s a culture thing but some staff no thank you or please. They tell you how it is, it’s like they had no customer service training what so ever. One even rolled her eyes at me! When I ask them for water or if they have food for my tod (of course I had some, but I did request when booking flight), they say I will check and never come back to me with an answer.  Flight attendants talk across the aisles and passing food and drinks to each other, over passengers heads. Very unprofessional and disorganised. Food choices and quality was poor, I know being in economy doesn’t help but I’ve seen and tasted better. When they run out of one option they say to me beef? Instead of apologising for running out of options and offering me beef. What if I had said no? Entertainment wasn’t bad. Seating was quite spacious (comparing to Virgin Atlantic).

1.0,Hugh Kidman,Oman,2018-04-22,the worst customer service,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cape Town to Riyadh via Addis Ababa. I fly regularly with Ethiopian Airlines for reasons of trip time. The staff are very friendly but the airline has the worst customer service. The return leg of the flight Cape Town - Addis Ababa - Riyadh flight was changed in itinerary in 2017 so that the all of the connecting international flights from Addis to Riyadh are 20 minutes after landing. The connecting flight includes a bus transfer to Terminal 2 and then a bus transfer from terminal 2 to terminal 1 (no direct option). This transfer time takes on average 40 minutes from time of landing (I have done this flight for 4 years 4-6 times a year) this means that the airline sells transfer / connecting flights that are impossible to catch. The first time I was caught out on this trip I ended up spending 9 hours in terminal 1 (a terminal that is not fit for international travellers in terms of cleanliness and facilities). On this occasion I had to wait 5 hours before anyone could tell me that a replacement flight could be obtained and waited an additional 4 hours for the next flight. The next time I flew this route after seeking assurance from the customer services that I could make the connecting flight, I ended up staying 24 hours and it took more than 12 hours before any representative could tell me; 1 if i would be getting another flight and 2 in this case a hotel. The local representative took my passport and returned it 12 hours later. Even now, if I phone and speak to supervisors of the airline they assure me that a 20 minute stopover on an international flight is acceptable. This means anyone on this flight will need the pilot to land in excess of 1 hour early. This is the issue with flights - however the real tragedy and stunning lack of assistance comes when trying to redeem airmiles. Having tried for 5 hours once with online assistance and 5 phone calls to Ethiopia South Africa and Saudi local offices, the transaction was not able to complete without a visit to a local branch - thus 3 hours online 2 hours of telephone calls and 1 and a half hours of trip to local office to get a single return flight – 6 and a half hours of time including lost working time. On a trip to South Africa in January this year I tried to upgrade my ticket to business class. This could not be achieved online so after 2 hours on the phone the assistant could not take payment of any of my credit cards. This left me with no option but to travel into central Cape Town to pay. On a separate occasion in the beginning of 2017 I received a (false) email message on a Saturday that my return flight to Saudi Arabia was being brought forward by 1 day. After 3 hours attempting to contact Ethiopian airlines locally and internationally (no answer local or on the international toll number) and a trip to the airport we found out the email was incorrect. I am not joking when I say that the list goes on. But systems that don’t work, false instructions impossible connections and lack of ability to contact or get assistance, staff not picking up telephones, local toll free numbers that do not work etc. mean that this airline is a disaster for the traveller.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Riyadh via Addis Ababa,2018-01-01,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3,no

When we boarded, I noticed there was no one on the seats on row 11 ahead of me. The row wasn't on an exit either and the other row 11 seats on the right and left were occupied each by a family with 2 kids each.  Also, there were several unoccupied window seats.

The cabin on the Boeing 787 is large, big windows and air humidity control, comfortable seats brightly colored in green upholstery all make for a pleasant journey. Even in economy class I received a travel kit with toothbrush, toothpaste, socks and a really useful eye-mask that actually helped me get to sleep and stay asleep. Food was served twice on the red-eye between BKK and ADD. I declined the first meal to sleep instead, but breakfast was acceptable with juices and hot coffee served. The terminal at ADD is a bit chaotic but was able to find restrooms, then a cafe with reasonably priced food and free wifi between flights. There are no lounges accessible with Priority Pass. Aside from Cloud 9 or Star Alliance lounges there are some open free areas with lounge beds that allow you to fully lie down and rest. Lunch between ADD and JRO, on an A330 this time, was tasty and went down well with red wine. Return flights were about the same in terms of food and flight comfort, and both legs were on the Dreamliner. Excellent IFE on the Dreamliner, plenty of choices of movies, documentaries and TV series.

9.0,G Meares,Oman,2018-02-02,no hesitation in recommending,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Zanzibar via Addis Ababa. My wife and I have travelled from UK to Zanzibar, typically once a year since 2001 and have just made our 17th such round trip, and for a second time with Ethiopian Airlines through Addis Abba. The service we received on all four legs was excellent with new  A350 aircraft on all but ADD - ZNZ which was a Boeing 787-8, that although it was beginning to look a little tired in places, was nevertheless a great aircraft to fly on. However the A350 is even better and noticably quieter especially when climbing after takeoff. Our four flights took off on time and arrived either on time or early. The standard service in Economy was both efficient and courteous, and could put other better known airlines covering the same destination via the Middle East that we have used, to shame. The food and beverage offer was better than one often finds on long haul economy and was served with charm by attentive cabin crews that clearly they wanted to be of service. As one might expect on the such a modern fleet of aircraft, the touch-screen in-flight entertainment worked well, was intuitive to use, and offered an excellent range of films and audio. Ingeniously, some days before departure Ethiopian Airlines invited on line bids to upgrade to ""Cloud 9"" business class on each leg, and we made an ""offer"" for the upgrade on the final ADD-LHR leg which was accepted. This gave us access to the comfortable ""Cloud 9"" lounge for the 5 hour layover between flights on the return which was very welcome. At some 7800ft above sea level, Addis Abba airport is in fact a very acceptable airport hub, though without the glitz and resultant high prices often found. An unusual and welcome feature are the various ""quiet"" areas around the terminal to while-away time between flights that have chaise-longue to stretch out full length on, as well as more conventional seats It is perhaps unusual to experience an airline's ""economy"" and ""business"" class offerings back to back on similar A350 aircraft, but we can confirm that ""Cloud 9"" compares very well with other long haul airlines that we have used previously.

Paid in full and received tickets, but month after this airline contacted me and told that they made a mistake with the tickets and I need to pay nearly half of what I have already paid if I want to have my tickets (govt taxes), otherwise they will be cancelled. I found out that Ethiopian Airlines breached IATA rules and issued tickets on Air Seychelles ticket stock. So about two months after they were issued, my tickets were cancelled and airline ignored all my requests to compensate expenses for already made travel arrangements.

3.0,Marian Williams,Oman,2018-01-11,should communicate with their passengers,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Ethiopian Airlines from Addis Ababa to Los Angeles. I went on holiday and flew with them twice and each time was frustrating. The attendants are rude and have an attitude about anything you ask them. During my first flight, I asked four different people for water and waited for over half an hour with nothing. I had to get up and go to the back, where they were all just sitting and talking. I proceeded to get my own water while they all looked at me. Then on the way back from my trip, we were told our flight was on time. Then we were told it was delayed 30 minutes due to a small issue. Then we heard nothing for two hours. My sister and I were travelling together. I bought our tickets together and specifically requested that we are seated together. I asked an attendant to change my seat since I specifically requested two seats together. She told me the flight was full and I should look in the computer myself to find a seat that was together. I went to another attendant on the place and she said there were many extra seats so she had no problem getting me two seats next to each other. Also, my flight was supposed to be a straight flight from Ethiopia to LAX but somehow we ended up in Dublin. I understand that they need to stop and refuel but they should communicate with their passengers. The Dublin authority came on the plane and requested to see all our boarding passes and passports and they made us get up to search through all our seats. It was too long for a trip to be that frustrating. I will never use this airline again.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Los Angeles,2018-01-01,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1,no

I found them sitting having conversations without any care for what was going on in the aircraft.

I had my luggage missing for a week in Madagascar, a place where it is impossible to find replacements. When the language arrived, several items were missing. Eventually, after several weeks of emails, they agreed for a 75$ compensation, which is ridiculously low. But as I said that it is an unacceptable sum they started to ignore my emails and I haven't received a cent. The planes were old, entertainment system is probably from the early 90s.

I only have positive things to say about Ethiopian Airlines. The service from the beginning was excellent from the staff. The boarding process was a little chaotic, but I feel that it was more due to the airports rather than the airline. Upon boarding, all passengers were  provided with a small care package of socks, eyemask, and ear plugs, which were a godsend to get some sleep. The food served onboard was excellent, I was served 3 meals and 2 snacks during my flight from Toronto > Addis Ababa. The movie selection was great, and I managed to stay entertained for the entire 13 hour flight. The plane itself was starting to show minor wear and tear, but nothing too terrible. The lavatories were kept very clean by the flight attendants. I had a much better experience with Ethiopian Air versus with the domestic US/Canada airlines. I would definitely travel with them again.

The new flight details routed me via Addis Ababa and Jo'burg but failed to provide a Jo'burg to Durban leg. I contacted Ethiopian by email as their Thailand Customer Service number did not exist. My email was acknowledged by computer but no one actually dealt with my problem despite 2 further emails that day. I organised my own flight from Jo'burg to Durban. Prior to my return flight I managed to get Ethiopian to provide a Durban to Jo'burg leg and thus I could continue my journey home. The flights were OK but boarding was as always late and at Addis Ababa we were directed to 3 different Gates by staff contrary to the Gate Information Boards before we got on the plane. The food was pretty awful. The Dreamliner 787 has the AV controls in the armrest - what idiot designer put them there? Every time you rest your arm or get up you change the AV system or call the stewardess or turn off a light. Probably a designer who has never flown before! On returning home it took ten days for the Customer relations to answer my complaint and they failed to address any of the points raised. I am still fighting them.

Pulled back on time, ie 01.05. Flight time was announced as 7 hrs 15 mins. Reduced size dinner due to time served at 0230, it was fine (I had eaten in a restaurant around 2030). Lights then put off for approx. 150 minutes, then breakfast served. For some reason we were forced to circle 3 times in stack over Essex so for no fault of the airline we didn't land till 06.55. As a very regular London to Addis Ababa flyer I love the A350 even more than Ethiopian's Boeing 787. Cannot fault the flight but was still waiting for bags at LHR T2 70 minutes after landing.

My review is strictly about the onboard food options. My partner and I placed special food orders beforehand and double and triplechecked to ensure it was properly understood. We ordered vegan options i.e. pure vegetarian i.e. free from animal flesh, egg or dairy (milk, creamer, cheese, margarine, butter etc.). We flew Cape Town to Addis / Addis to Dublin return. Cape Town to Addis was fine. Every trip after that was problematic. My partner and I were sometimes given different options, and often these options included dairy of some kind. Sometimes there weren't even dairy-free coffee creamer options available. Staff need to be trained to properly understand various dietary requirements. I don't know how it compares to other on-board airline food, but these were quite boring.

10.0,Frank Rispin,Oman,2017-09-29,the A350 beats them all,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Addis Ababa on Ethiopian Airlines A350. Their 787 and 777s are great too but the A350 is quicker. I have used it twice to Addis this year, January it was only 6 hrs 30 mins flying time, this time 6 hrs 45 minutes. Have flown London to Addis many times on BMI. KLM, Luthansa, Emirates and the old East African Airways in the 70s. Ethiopian Airlines current service and the A350 beats them all. Even LHR Terminal 2, of which I am not fond, was smooth this time with very helpful staff at bag drop. This overnight flight to Addis is at 9pm in UK summer and 8.00pm UK winter. We rolled back in an almost full plane at 9.30 pm. The dinner served about 11 pm was great, on the box it said chicken curry but it was a lovely chicken tika masala and other items on the tray were also excellent. They serve Habesha, one of several excellent Ethiopian lagers but unfortunately do not yet do Ethiopia's first class Rift Valley wines. Arrived Addis 06.30 and visas on arrival was also extremely efficient and quick despite a queue of around 30 people. I fly London to Addis return on average three times a year and right now would not consider any other airline for it. In the past 2 years have also flown Addis Bangkok return, Addis to Capetown, Joburg to Addis. All excellent flights with no problems.

1.0,Marie-Louise Mercer,Oman,2017-09-25,cheapest price but think twice,"✅ Verified Review | You may think you want to fly the cheapest price but think twice. On our trip this month, after buying the ticket in May, we were told 5 weeks before return flight that there had been some changes and that we had to call in. No phone number was given to call of course. I call USA number and was told the flight was cancelled and we had to return a day later. I confirmed the new reservations. I then had to re-buy new domestic connection tickets on my dime. While we were in Madagascar, with no phone we kept getting emails that our flight was cancelled and that we had to call. We could not connect a call even on Skype. We finally connected with Ethiopian on departure date and it turned out that they had not cancelled the original reservation so that they had duplicate reservations. This took over $100 of cell minutes to establish. When we checked in for return flight from Madagascar, Ethiopian could not print the boarding passes for the onward ticket from Addis Ababa to Washington DC. We were told not to worry and that we would be met at the plane and given our boarding passes. The plane departed Madagascar late after they refused to allow us to carry on bags (despite a check in 3.5 hours early amd half the plane been allowed to). We are now in Addis Ababa and find that there is an unannounced extra stop in Dublin and that our seats have been given away.

Outbound both flights were on time. On the return, EBB-ADD was about one hour late. This was no problem since we still had sufficient time in ADD (and the lounge in ADD terminal 1 was abysmal anyway). Seats in the Ethiopian B737 were of the old cradle type and did not incline very far. Still they were spacious and comfortable and, using the fold-out footrests, allowed for a nice nap. No IFE was available. Food and inflight staff on all four legs were simply excellent! Friendly proactive flight attendants served an excellent selection of Ethiopian and international dishes, accompanied by exceptionally high-quality wine. The two business class lounges in ADD couldn’t be have been more different.

2.0,Isabella Andrews,Oman,2017-08-24,no vegan meals arranged,"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Cape Town via Addis Ababa. We booked our tickets in January 2017 to fly 19th July 2017. The very next day, I emailed ethiopian airlines to enquire about our special meals and about seating. I had been struggling since day one and kept receiving errors online. Constant emails throghout the year until we eventully flew in July, they confirmed our meals and seating.. Our trip from Vienna to Addis, was awful. Our seating was out by one row which meant we did not get the arranged seating but was put in front of the toilets which flushed all night. The hostess struggled with english and when we told her we had requested special meals, she took out slips of paper out of her apron and checked our seating and said no, nothing had been arranged! We did have emergency exit seats from Addis to Cape Town but no vegan meals arranged? The air stewards / hostesses were not friendly or welcoming but short and abrupt. Lights stayed on until 2am after the hostesses walked around chatting to each other with duty free trolleys while people tried to sleep. We did not sleep a wink. I saw and hear other people around me complain that when they called a hostess, they did not come. One man kept buzzing for about 20 minutes and eventually she appeared. A woman had requested something to drink an hour or more ago and she explained that it was the third time she had asked and still nothing. We did however, have only one person who was extremely helpful ( Global Call Center Ethiopian Airlines, Bole International Airport) and communicated with me before our flights and after but this issue is now out of her hands and was sent to the customer service by me 8 days ago and no reply.

First they forgot our Luggage on our way there and we were 4 days without our luggage. Then on our way back our flight was delayed and therefore we missed our connecting flight to Frankfurt. As a result we had to stay 24 hours in Addis Ababa in a hotel. But getting to the hotel was difficult because there was chaos everywhere and the ground stuff was more than unfriendly! They sent us from one counter to another and noone had any information on what we can do now! In the end we reached that hotel at 3am after spending 3 hours at the airport waiting for our shuttle. This was the most horrible flight I've ever had and the airline didn't handle it very well. I will never take this airline again and also won't recommend you to take it.

Seat malfunctioned in DUB, and despite efforts by crew and myself it would not recline even using manual override control under cushion. As cabin was sold out, I lost the opportunity to sleep on a very long flight. I contacted customer service and requested some compensation, who forwarded my details to the central office. Then nothing for 2 weeks until I had to re-inquire. Finally they came back and offered me US$50 or 2,000 Sheba miles. When I said that this seemed insufficient to cover the loss of the seat for 10+hrs, then said I had ""utilized all the services of business class"", but ""to reclaim my confidence"" offered to increase their offer to 2,500 Sheba miles. Needless to say I will not be flying Ethiopian again, and I would urge others to think twice.

8.0,Marius Henkel,Oman,2017-08-05,the best idea in East Africa,"✅ Verified Review |  Lilongwe to Nairobi via Addis Ababa, they are currently the cheapest option to go. The flight was via Addis Abeba but still only half the price than a direct flight. Ethiopian usually uses a 737-800 for the LLW-ADD leg and stops in Blantyre, but on Saturdays and Sundays, it is replaced by a 767-300 and there are two seperate flights to Lilongwe and Blantyre. Check In in Lilongwe was messy, as the Check In Agents were the slowest in the world and the ticketing system failed due to a electronic problem. Ethiopian asks its passengers to arrive 3 hours prior to departure which is definetly a good call. As the online system does not know, that on Saturdays and Sundays the aircraft is changed, seats can not be preselected and so it was first come first sit. The flight was on time to depart and about 20 minutes early in Addis. Although the aircraft used was a pretty worn down 767, the seats turned out to be quite comfy and the legroom was enormous. Food was great (I preordered vegetarian) and the crew was very nice and welcoming. Bole International Airport in Addis Abeba is one of the worst managed airports I have ever been to, so as good as the flight was, as bad was the airport. The flight from Addis to Nairobi was on a new 737-800 and although it was packed full, boarding and takeoff were on time. Again very nice and friendly crew and good food. To put it in a nutshell: Flying with Ethiopian is usually the best idea in East Africa, their only downturn is their base at Bole Airport.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lilongwe to Nairobi via Addis Ababa,2017-07-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,5,yes

English announcements (I encountered this on domestic flights and my return too) appeared to be someone reading and transliterating from Amharic into a language they don't speak, which was hilarious on occasion.

1.0,G Vanderne,South Africa,2017-08-02,booked flight on another airline,"✅ Verified Review |  Riyadh to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa. I booked a flight with Attar travels and paid cash for my ticket. On arrival at the airport in Riyadh I should in the line at the counter from 12 midnight waiting for check-in till 3.30am. No one showed up to check us in or explain anything to us. Because we continued to wait till after 3.30am (flight departure time), security asked us to move outside with our luggage. No one was explaining if there was a technical problem or flight cancellation or just a delay. No one from Ethiopian airlines was at the airport to assist with any queries. It turned out to be that this flight was delayed five times for the day. After numerous enquiries it was discovered that Ethiopian airlines was removing illegal immigrants from Saudi Arabia on flights that we had paid for. Eventually when they decided to check us in, they issued me with incorrect boarding passes and I ended up walking from one terminal to the next to try and correct this, until I missed my flight. I was told to wait for the next nights check-in at 12 and see the manager who would be able to assist me. So considering I already waited about 12 hours, I waited for the manager who refused to help anyone. There were a lot of people with similar problems. The manager told us to go to the Ethiopian office in Riyadh at 10am the next day to have new tickets reissued to us. So I was desperate and did so. On arrival I was greeted by more than 50 customers and only one officer to help us. Having already wasted two days at the airport, I decide this was enough and booked a flight on another airline and flew home to South Africa the next day. I have never experienced anything so horrifying in my entire life before. Not a soul can offer you an explaination or any reassurance, leave food or water or a place to rest and can you imagine having not slept in more than 24 hours.

On the negative side, Addis Ababa airport is still one of the worst in the world, with chaos and dirt everywhere. The lounges are only slightly better than in a US domestic airport and Ethiopian ground staff yell at passengers and rush them through the gates all the time. The  inflight catering is stale and poorly presented, far from business class standards, despite a recent revamp of the menus and plating.

However, at Nairobi my luggage was not there so we had to file a missing luggage report which took an hour. The counter staff informed that there are 3 remaining flights from Ethiopia to Nairobi and For the next few days, I have been checking online on whether the luggage was located but the status was 'Tracing continues' which was bad news. I only received my luggage 4 days later which was quite disruptive to my plans. Although this was an unfortunate event, I was overall quite pleased with the way the staff handled the situation. On my return flight, the flight from Nairobi to Addis Ababa was delayed for 2 hours. This caused many passengers who had connecting flights in Ethiopia to miss their flights. Passengers were told to go to various counters with no one at the counters. I was lucky enough to catch my flight. However, the information on the board directed me to go to Gate 13. At Gate 13, we were then informed that it was at Gate 4 and many of us had to run to the other end of the airport. One lady politely told the ground staff that there could be quite a number of people still queueing at Gate 13 and something needs to be done so that these people wouldn't miss their flights but she was brushed off with a nonchalant attitude. Overall, the plane ride was smooth.

1.0,P Johnson,South Africa,2017-06-28,very poor service and poor quality,"✅ Verified Review |  Worst airline I have ever flown! We were delayed for 4 hours with no communication from ground staff. We were merely told to sit down every time we wanted to know why we were waiting. No access to even a drop of drinking water. The ground staff were extremely rude and would walk away while you were still talking to them. The food on the aircraft was disgusting, and I ended up not eating. The aircrafts are dirty and old with no inflight entertainment. This is the 3rd time in a row that they have lost my bags (I travel with them every 2 months) not by choice but my company books us on these flights. I received zero assistance regarding my bags, no phone calls or emails get answered and I'm told to go check every time an aircraft lands if my bags arrived. After a lengthy delay not even the crew could tell us why we were delayed (surely you should know as crew why you are taking off 4 hours late). Very unprofessional, very poor service and poor quality. Definitely do not recommend travelling with them unless you feel like sitting for lengthy periods waiting at airports not drinking even a glass of water, like people being rude to you, not eating your entire trip and feel like living off the bare minimum for a week because they loose you bag.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Bamako via Addis,2017-06-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
1.0,M Martin,South Africa,2017-06-20,left me with a bad taste,"✅ Verified Review | Paris to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa with Ethiopian Airlines. A chaotic check in experience for a packed flight at CDG. Boarding was supposed to be via zone, but when boarding time came at CDG it was every man for himself. Basically it was organized chaos. Passengers boarded with hand luggage that did not fit into the overhead compartments, and I ended up helping the cabin crew repack the compartments to fit everything in, as I am quite tall. The flight from CDG to ADD was the noisiest, smelliest flight I have ever been on, and 4 hours into the 6.5 hour journey, I wanted to use the toilet. The floor and toilet was covered in urine and toilet paper. I reported this to the cabin crew and nothing was done about it. The interior was the the most tired and dated I have been on, and my inflight entertainment was working on and off. Food service was abysmal, and after service the crew disappeared for the rest of the flight. The aircraft was quite dirty and one of the overhead bins opened in ADD when we were slammed into the ground upon landing. The leg from ADD to JNB was also in a 777-200LR, but on the upside it was quite empty. Meal service on this leg was a snack and a lunch and from all the meals this was passable. Service in general was OK, but nothing to rave about. In general the whole Ethiopian experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would suggest that the airline focus on customer service, and do something to fix abysmal ADD airport before they consider expanding further. A more modern cabin refresh wouldn't hurt either.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa,2017-06-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no

Check in at JNB went very smoothly. The equipment was changed from a 777-300ER to an A350. The aircraft was modern, but the Ethiopian interior made it look dated instantly. Overall seat comfort is acceptable provided the flight is empty. The cabin wasn't very clean, and meal service was barely passable. The Cabin Crew made up for the dismal food and drink by being friendly. Boarding at ADD was chaotic to say the least. Aircraft was a 787, and was in a generally good condition. Quite an empty flight, so you could stretch out. The meal served was exactly the same as on the previous leg.

9.0,Pratap Raychaudhuri,South Africa,2017-06-06,very happy with Ethiopian Airlines,"✅ Verified Review | I traveled from Mumbai to Sao Paolo visa Addis-Ababa and back on end-May, Early June. I have to say that I am very happy with Ethiopian Airlines. The in-flight staff are friendly and courteous, the cabins well-maintained. But most importantly, the planes fly on time. Addis-Ababa airport is somewhat crowded but not quite as bad as most people make out to be. I think it is mostly the shock in comparison with swanky modern airports that catch people off-guard. But when you get over that the airport is actually function quite ok and the staff are by and large helpful. Particularly, if your stop-over is less that 3 hours, it is not a problem at all. For longer stop-overs the small size could make it a bit boring. For the Mumbai-Addis Ababa route the planes are either Boeing 777 or Boeing 737 when the number of passenger is less. The latter does not have personalized screen with every seat which is a negative. However, they play a movie on the common screen. On the Addis Ababa - Sau Paolo route the plane is Boeing 787 (Dreamliner). The food is sumptuous, but Ethipian could consider bring in some variety. On my way from Addis-Ababa to Sao Paolo the same meal was served on three occasions. Agreed that it is a relatively cheap airlines, but a little variety would not increase cost. On the whole I would fly Ethiopian again, and would recommend anyone who is not unnecessarily snooty about small things.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Sao Paolo via Addis Ababa,2017-06-01,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes

There is a real problem with their meals -  uninspiring in Business and inedible in Economy, and it is getting worse despite their new catering facilities.

7.0,Rainer Jehl,South Africa,2017-05-16,"choose Ethiopian, you choose Africa","✅ Verified Review |  Dar es Salaam to Kuala Lumpur via Addis Ababa / Bangkok. I mostly fly with a bicycle (think of Pippi Longstocking). At Ethiopian Airlines you can't add special baggage online to your flight, even not attach a notice. But sports equipment is on their baggage scedule and a good fare for bicycles is given (100 USD for intercontinental flights). I went and booked from Tanzania (online), they have no call-center there, even Ethiopian is operating much from Dar es Salaam. An email to the airport office was not answered in 9 days. I called up to 8 telephone numbers before I reached somebody, who was kind, but don't understood what he should do with 'bicycle', while I wanted to go by aircraft. The clerk absolutely not knowed, how to book special baggege to a flight and what sports equipment should be. I should call the city office, where nobody answered the phone. The nearest callcenter in Addis Ababa not worked technically in Tanzania. So after 5 days with no success to get the bicycle on my flight, I visited the Ethiopian Dar es Salaam city office, where a very kind women tried to understand what I want, but after all not find any way to get the special baggage booked. After 1 day she wrote me a nice email, I should call the airport office, where another kind woman told me, she can't do anything, but I should simply bring the bicycle packed to check-in. They will take it in any case. At the check-in I was told, the packed bicycle is very welcome and will cost 250 USD. I referenced the website price of 100 USD, and the ground manager told me the bicycle are welcome, the cost is 200 USD, payable only cash. I was short in funds and so I had to organize Tanzanian Shilling from ATM. The only properly working international ATM at Julius-Nyerere-Airport was defect, so while check-in runs, I jumped with a taxi to the closest bank. The ground handling manager then took 500.000 Tanzanian Shilling, which are 223 USD (Mai 2017). The baggage (all within the limits) was proceeded and a view minutes later I got a receipt upon 200 USD received for excess baggage with many thanks. This is typical african and I found deals like that many times on my half year visit of north and east africa. The new old spirit. It is still less expensive as the excess baggage rates for bicycles at other carriers, but not the 100 $, which were wide spread for sports baggage intercontinental. On the other hand the flight was nice. I can't complain either the crew nor the aircrafts. The girls were nice and smiley and the jets clean, comfortable and fully functional, while in Africa on the ground nearly everything is dirty and disfunctional.  For me, the crowd is also a part of flight quality. People, who complain the 'uneatable' meals on board never have been eating in Ethiopia. Compared with the food of simple people or what is served even in better restaurants, the onboard meals were luxury. They serve also Ethiopian beer which is very tasty. A bit disorganized Bole Airport (Addis). But in total it worked, many seats and loungers, fairly clean restrooms, shops with enough merchandise. No comparison to outside the airport.

1.0,I Mizune,South Africa,2017-05-15,the shock came in Addis,"✅ Verified Review |  Harare to Marrakech via Madrid. The flight from Harare to Addis was great. The shock came in Addis when flight ET712 to Madrid was overbooked. Upon checking in at Gate 9 (changed from Gate 1), the Ethiopian Airline officers stood three of us aside, apparently because our visa to Spain and Morocco had to be verified by a senior airline officer. Myself, a man from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a lady from Equatorial Guinea. During the check-in process, the man from the Congo protested fiercely, and was let in. As the queue died, we (me and the lady from Malabo) went to the boarding desk to get the EA senior to verify our VISA's to facilitate. The Ethiopian Airline officer handling the boarding looked aside and shouted, Boarding closed we will re-route you. The senior officer had not pitched up. No one had spoken to us. Nothing. I couldn't believe it that an airline would cook false stories to manage its own problem of overbooking. Fastforward to 02:00 Addis Time, 3 hours after the initial boarding time, we were still in their office and the lady from Malabo promised to get into another flight on Tuesday May 16th. I refused calmly and with smiles of spite. They tried to get me into ET702 to go to Morocco through Rome and i refused, returning their initial transit VISA lie that if i could not do a 60 minute transit to Morocco through Madrid, then i still could not take option of going through Rome, albeit 48 hours later. Later, another officer assisted by getting me proceed to Morocco by EgyptAir. His reason for my transfer ""flight overbooked"". And at this time I asked to see the Supervisor. The supervisor did not come. As this batch of officer's prepared to go home at 03h00, my AirEgypt flight to Cairo was also boarding. I left Addis without seeing the supervisor or getting the truth.

For a frequent flyer like me, Ethiopian Airlines is a default choice for travelling across Africa because of its extensive network and, credit where due, on time performance. The good stops here as it is decades behind the service level that a global standard airline (or even Kenya Airways) would offer. Boarding in Nairobi, Addis and Lagos was disorganized, with no separate lines for Gold / Business Class. Despite being new, planes look worn with unresponsive touch screens, very limited movie selection and poor quality earphones. Food was utterly inedible and the service protocol is weird - Ethiopian dishes are available on flights originating from Addis but not explicitly offered to passengers by the crew. Addis Ababa is the worst airport in Africa: dirty, poorly lit and completely overcrowded. The same goes for Ethiopian Airlines lounges.

They even refused to provide a mother with a bassinet. Inedible food again - who serves cold shredded chicken with uncooked, bland rice and tomato sauce?

Small sandwich & drink would do 1hr after take off. But worse, the cabin lights on full till 01.50 then back on at 15.20. Given Ethiopian Airlines don't give you eye masks it was impossible to sleep on this overnighter. Left Addis Ababa 1hr late as boarding seemed to be staff talking amongst themselves, the Boeing 777 leg was uneventful and comfortable thanks to 3-3-3 configuration and IFE slightly easier than 787.

My Ethiopian Airlines flight departed Kinshasa 4 hours late and arrived at Addis Ababa 11:30 pm (local time) with hundreds of others passengers and no organized arrangements ready for us. Waited 2 hours and after getting a hotel voucher, I had to argue and demand my checked bag back for my unexpected 24 hour visit to Ethiopia. I was sent outside the airport at 2am (alone) with luggage to look for a hotel van that was not there but there were lots of locals trying to get me into their cabs. After 40 mins waiting, airline staff finally came outside and sent me to a different hotel whose van was there. Most passengers on this flight left their homes early in the morning in Kinshasa because it usually takes 3 hours to get to the airport from downtown in order to check in 2 hours before the flight. We were finally served a tuna sandwich and warm soda 3 hours after our scheduled departure time in the waiting area of the airport. 3 hours later and nearly 10 hours after leaving my home that morning I was finally given a meal on the plane with warm soda and no ice. According to the staff, the ice melted due to the delay and there was no ice for the entire flight to ADD. I hope this gives you a better understanding of the level of fatigue I had when we arrived at nearly midnight and that every minute of delay at the airport made things more difficult. I have never eaten dinner at 3 am in a hotel before. Returned to airport for my new flight home and my name was flagged for secondary security check where they proceeded to go through every item in my luggage and purse taking everything out (for the entire waiting area to see all of my personal belongings without any privacy). Of course I protested and demanded a supervisor who tried to blame the screening on the US government. I am a U.S. Diplomat and there were many of us on that flight. So when they tell me that the US government picked my name for secondary inspection - I am very qualified to know that was not a true statement.

Checked in at Nairobi at the business class counters which was a pleasant experience. Flight from NBO-ADD was on time on a brand new A380. Clean cabin with a pleasant feeling. Food pre-ordered with one hot dish served. On reaching Addis disembarkation was without any hassles. ADD Airport was crowded with many transit passengers. Lounge was located on the other side of the boarding hall, whole lounge to ourselves like three persons. Special arrangements for serving Ethiopian Coffee in traditional way was another good experience. But food choice was not up to the mark in the lounge. Boarding experience on ADD-BOM leg was not so pleasant, complete havoc and looked like they merged two planes together / adjusted on delayed connecting passengers from different aircraft. Inflight services good but the way the drinks and juices are served is a little immature. Food served was great, a salmon steak. Seating quality was good in comparison to other aircrafts. Disembarkation at BOM was with out any big hassles and baggage services also needs to be addressed as baggage arrived after 35 minutes (Priority baggage).",Business,Business Class,NBO to BOM via ADD,2016-09-01,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4,yes

Quite a pleasant flight in economy on Boeing 787, I was impressed with the meals - first time I've had Salmon as dinner. Quite the opposite in the older Boeing 767 used in Africa. One thing that struck me was the inattentiveness of the staff. Several passengers requested assistance by pressing the button during the flight but I never saw a single being attended to. I requested assistance but after ten minutes decided to walk into the galley myself to get something to drink. The thing that really is bad with Ethiopian is the transfer in Addis Ababa. This is one of the worst Airports I have been to and it really needs an upgraded terminal. A delayed flight by two hours in Addis Ababa with no information, quoted by pilot as being caused by Aircraft rotation, is also one reason I'm probably not using Ethiopian again.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,NBO to ARN via ADD,2017-01-01,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3,no

Ethiopian Airlines looks like it's stuck between a no-frills and a full service airline model. Boeing 787s which already look worn (broken seat parts) even though they're modern with unresponsive IFE touch screens and a limited amount of entertainment. I heard that Ethiopian Airlines opened a brand new catering facility but they still serve the same awful tomato chicken and rice and industrial breakfasts with bright pink sausages. Such a shame for an airline that could represent Ethiopia's incredible culinary tradition. No inflight magazine available on any flight and night kits randomly distributed to a few passengers only - same goes for pillows and blankets. Boarding disorganized and chaotic with no separate line for Star Gold/Business class passengers. Bole airport is worse than ever with filthy toilets, overcrowded boarding areas and no wifi. The only nice thing is that both flights were on time, which is good enough. I have flown Ethiopian Airlines at least once a month in the past 3 years and despite its aggressive marketing campaigns, it provides a subpar service and is still decades behind its competitors in Africa such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, Emirates and Turkish Airlines.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,KUL to NBO via ADD,2017-01-01,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4,no

However, flight schedule was changed several times before I even went to the airport. Even at airport, gates frequently changed and transport to plane was by delayed buses. Cheap prices, average food, but older planes with no individual seat screens. Addis Abba airport badly in need of upgrade. First to have sleeper seats but old and crowded. A few shops selling Chinese goods in US dollars. Wanted to shower and change in washrooms after several overnight flights - too crowded to do so. Basement was pitch dark and freezing cold (exposed to the elements). Toilet was a temporary trailer with porta-potties. Strong smell and windows open so everyone in lounge can see and hear you. Supposedly loading by zones but first zone called and no other - everyone just queued up to get on helter-skelter. One problem was that they did not load the disabled first - one women had to get out of her wheelchair and queue up with regular passengers at plane entrance to get to her seat. Naturally, this was difficult for her and slow. Why they did not follow other airline's policies and load the disabled and families with small kids first is beyond me.

1.0,Lara Bennett,South Africa,2017-01-08,"incompetent, rude and unhelpful","✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Durban via Addis Ababa. This was the worst experience I have ever had on an airline. The flight from Dubai to Addis Ababa was set to arrive in Addis at 07h55. The boarding time was 07h45 and the plane departed at 08h30. Based on these times alone, it was an impossibility that we would catch the connecting flight - they could not give us a reason for the late departure. My husband and I (and many other passengers) expressed their concern to cabin crew that we would not make our connecting flights. We were assured that the captain had communicated with ground staff and that our plane was waiting for us. We arrived in Addis and were escorted to a bus. We were then told to stand in a queue. When we asked why we were in a queue and not boarding our plane we were stared at blankly. We (and about 30 other people) soon realised that the planes that were ""waiting for us"" had all departed. We finally got to the front of the queue after waiting for about 50 minutes and were told we would just have to wait until the flight the next day. This was Christmas Eve. After much argument, my husband turned on his roaming and found a flight that day. The people behind us piped up and said they also wanted that flight. The staff grabbed all our passports into a bundle and came back with two tickets for the people who had pushed in front of us and said they only had two tickets so we would have to wait until the next day! The staff were incompetent, rude and unhelpful. We stood there for about 2 hours trying to get them to help us. They would go and hide in the corner so they didn't have to help us. When the manager finally arrived he was unapologetic and incompetent. When we complained that we couldn't only get to Durban late on Christmas eve instead of on 23rd they said ""well then you can fly on Christmas day"". We asked about compensation for our car hire and hotel in Durban that we were missing and were laughed at. The gentleman in front of us was offered another flight on 26 December. We ended up having to stay in Addis overnight and take 2 connecting flights to get to Durban on the evening of Christmas Eve. They took another hour to find our luggage for the ""hotel"". The hotel they put us in was dirty, had power cuts, the elevator didn't work and hotel staff walked into our room 3 times without so much as a knock saying ""oh, I thought you had left"" or ""oh, someone is in here"". The bathroom had cockroaches and we were given no monetary compensation. The way that Ethiopian Airlines staff treated us was the worst part, as if it was a joke that we were missing precious time with our families. I tried to call Ethiopian Airlines in South Africa on about 8 different numbers to cancel our return flight and get a refund. The numbers either cut out or just rang. I eventually had to turn on roaming and called the Ethiopia office. I was put on hold for 30 minutes and then told he couldn't help me and I should call South Africa. I told him that no one answers and he said he didn't know then. We physically went into the office in Cape Town and canceled our return flights on 28 December 2016. We are still waiting for the refund! Addis Ababa airport is dirty and disgusting. The toilets are worse than festival toilets and their duty free doesn't have working card machines. I complained at first that Emirates were too expensive but now realise that you get what you pay for.

The free seating out of NSI went without issue. In business class, great service. Very attentive FA. Only about 6 pax in the whole cabin so we were pampered.

They are obviously so proud of their nation - that comes across in their service. I had a very tight connection in Addis - just 35mins. We landed and I was on the connecting plane in 15 mins! That is because they want it to happen. As the plane land came to a stop the stairs pulled up, the coach arrived and someone asked where you were connecting to. Whisked away on the coach to be met in the terminal by someone else asking where we were going. She asked me to wait to one side and then took me directly to the Cape Town plane in seconds - everyone else had already boarded and I took my seat.

I choose Ethiopian Airlines when I get a reasonable ticket price, as I find travelling via Addia Ababa can be a bit of a challenge. This trip started in Juba, South Sudan that is an airport of itself, not an easy one to travel through. I checked in day before and got for the first leg the seat 27C, only to find out on board there was only 25 rows. However there was empty seats so no big deal. The catering on the flight tough was a real disappointment, before we used to get a decent sandwich and a dink service. This time it was a box containing a napkin, a small bottle of water and a minimal piece of bread. No drink trolley was seen. To their advantage we departed 30 minutes early tough. Next leg Juba to Stockholm as at 2355 and i had a good 4 hours in Addis to spend the time.  Gate on my boarding pass was shown as number 9 but on the airport screens I could read number 12. Closer to the departure I went towards gate 12 but me and a number of fellow passengers for the flight was shown to gate 10. So after security check I went to gate 10 but was told to proceed to gate 12 via a locked glass door 'somebody will open it later'. After some time we were some 50+ people waiting for the door to be opened when a ground staff came and directed us to gate 1 in the other end of the terminal in the basement. The basement area was almost pitch black (no power), and gate 1 was already full of people, but I heard a voice in the darkness calling Rome and Stockholm passengers to go to gate 6. The confusion was close to a Jacque Tati movie but at the same time I found it quite amusing. Others did not. Eventually we boarded and the flight departed only some 30 minutes late to Stockholm via Rome. Flight was close to full on both sectors, service good and food acceptable. And to my surprise we arrived Stockholm 30 minutes early so I guess there is some margin in the schedule. Generally I find their cabin crew quite good and accommodating, Food between bad and average but travelling thru Addis Ababa is really a challenge at times. The company should have improved Bole transit and departure areas long time ago, as it can be a real struggle passing thru. I can recommend Ethiopian Airlines to experienced and somewhat hardened travelers that do not expect what the commercials are telling you. It can be really okay, but also be quite of a roller coaster. If the price is right I may go for ET again, but if I get a better competitor for a similar price the option is obvious.

Called agents and they informed me that they cancelled reservation but unable to give answer as to why they cancelled reservation. Finally got rebooked after four phone calls but still on waiting list for last leg of journey. Called again and they say no seats available. Went online and I can clearly see seats available and am able to book on the final leg myself. Informed Ethiopian Airlines of the seat availability and they said they will see what they can do. Nothing done to resolve problem. Encountered many lies from agents, they will inform that they will call you back but dont have your hopes up for this, they will never call you. If you call to follow up be prepared to be disconnected for no reason. Also remember according to them, it's never their fault. If anything goes wrong with booking you will suffer because the reservations agents are incompetent and unwilling to resolve problem. No one can explain how a confirmed booking can be cancelled yet the same journey can be repurchased online again, so flights were not cancelled but reservation cancelled for a phantom reason. After desperation, I ended up paying for another ticket, which is much easier to do than to deal with the airlines agents. Pay a little more and travel another airline, its not worth being stranded in another country and the airline will not do anything about it.

We were assured that connecting flights will wait for this flight to land. Well, when we landed, I asked if the flight to Douala left, they said 'no'. The crew at the Airport had prepared boarding passes for all connecting passengers. Mine and several were not printed.

Friendly and helpful staff with good information and announcements. Food ok - I asked for a special meal and was provided. Transit at Addis is straightforward. You can be directed right into the waiting area. If you are remember no facilities here apart from toilets and seats. It does get very crowded especially if you are in the area for gates 1-7 in the International terminal which uses buses to and from the gates. But organised in that announcements are made and there are good screens showing the information. If you are a premium customer or Star Alliance Gold but travelling economy you can use a separate area in that section - comfortable chairs, water and separate buses. Ethiopian do look after regular travellers and their premium customers. Their prices are often the cheapest between southern africa and Europe. Give them a go if on a budget but be prepared for a transit in Addis that doesn't have all the creature comforts you might want so try and keep transit times to a minimum.

The quality of the journey was way different between the flight forth and the flight back. The first, was a very nice experience highlighting a very kind onboard service and amazing aircraft (Addis Abeba - Sao Paulo by a Boeing 787). But problems started on the way back. First, the aircraft was changed without any previous notification. The original flight was supposed to be flown also by a Boeing 787 but instead aircraft was changed to an old and dirty Boeing 777-2. I received an aisle seat which was pretty broken: the control panel on the handrail was destroyed and the touch-screen did not react to tact, but it had to be controlled by the broken panel on the handrail. Besides I stand up to the bathroom in 3 occasions during the flight while in all of them the lavatories were stinky and disgusting. Unfortunately, problems did not finish there since my bag was mistreated during the journey resulting in a broken wheel and the handle which was very hard to lift. On my arrival to the Airport in Tel Aviv I approached Aerohandling counters (the company handling Ethiopian Airlines in-land services at TLV), I was attended by a very rude man, and I was denied service while I was given a letter saying that the company will not be responsible for the damage caused to my luggage.

1.0,Natalie Chun,South Africa,2016-11-09,the worst customer service,"✅ Verified Review |  Addis Ababa to Windhoek with Ethiopian Airlines. One of the worst customer service experience ever encountered. On 7th November, 14 people missed a flight from Addis Ababa to Gabone/Windhoek because there was no bus driver on the bus that we were told to board. A driver finally came 5-10 minutes later, but he had no clue where the airplane was and simply drove us in a circle around the airport before arriving back at the departure gate. It took 30 more minutes for them to admit that the plane had already left as the airline does not have policy of counting passengers in the plane. Ground staff/customer service agents also admitted to their mistake. We have booked 2 Ethiopian Airlines flights and both times this has happened. The first time we got lucky as more than 20+ people got stuck in the airport in Zanzibar for a flight from Zanzibar to Addis Ababa. This time we were not so lucky. Compensation for more than a day and a half of lost time, hotel bookings and lost meetings? Initial offer: Nothing except an economy class re-booking on a later flight about 15 hours later. Subsequent offer: After much haggling a $300 voucher or $150 cash even though we had asked what is considered a reasonable request of $200 cash. However, two things to note about the offer. First no passengers were able to get the cash in Addis Ababa as the customer service officers claimed to not have cash on hand. Second the voucher is less valuable than the cash as you must buy the tickets through the airline ticket office which is often at least $150 higher than any ticket you would buy online. The customer service also used a stalling tactic by handing us off from one officer to the next. After 9 hours of waiting an agent finally came that told us they would come back within 10 minutes so that people could receive their cash and concerns would be addressed. However, no one showed up for another few hours giving only a half hour before boarding in which they claimed that there was no cash available because they do not handle money. One last thing to note is that of the 12 passengers that were routed to Windhoek (Namibia) via Johannesburg from Addis Ababa 4 of these passengers did not board the early morning flight on Air Namibia flight that Ethiopian Airlines had said they had booked from Johannesburg to Windhoek. Upon arrival at the transit desk the officer for Air Namibia stated that the tickets were either not booked or canceled. In the end the customer service people aggravated 14 customers who likely now will try to avoid flying Ethiopian Airlines whenever possible.

5.0,S Ross,South Africa,2016-09-30,no apologies onboard from anyone re the delay,"✅ Verified Review |  Just returned from a short trip Tel Aviv - Addis Ababa - Kinshasa - Addis Ababa - Tel Aviv. Unfortunately Ethiopian Airlines is always a let down in one way or another. I believe this will be my last trip with them. Its back to AF/KL/BA/LH. The way over was great, B738 TLV to ADD, friendly crew, good food, comfortable bulkhead seat and nice music channels. Addis Bole airport is an insult to ET and Star Alliance. Crowded, dirty, disgusting bathrooms, chaotic boarding procedures. The B772 to FIH was empty, so I had 3 seats for myself and the crew were friendly (all females). The return trip was a very different story, it's where ET fails in every aspect of service. I had a reserved seat FIH-ADD, emergency exit, as I need leg room to avoid back pain and free access to the bathroom. Of course ET changed equipment at the last minute to B738, I lost my good seat and on top of it a two hour delay in Kinshasa due to the Aircraft change. No word from the local staff re the delay, no word about AC change, I had to struggle with a most unfriendly agent to get an aisle seat. No apologies onboard from anyone re the delay, not the Captain nor the Inflight manager. I guess passengers should expect to lose their long time assigned seats, spend hours waiting and get zero 'sorry'. One Cabin crew member was great when I told her my story, she was apologetic, sincere and warm. When landing in ADD, passengers started opening overheads while in taxi, left them open so items could fall and injure passengers. The crew did nothing to stop this. Again Bole airport a crowded dirty mess, the flight to TLV was late one hour without any explanation, I guess it's the norm at ET. The only shining Star at ET is their cabin crew. I made it home safely and that's all that counts.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,TLV to FIH via ADD,2016-09-01,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3,no

The aircraft leaving luanda was a very nice Boeing 777, it was good for the money spent. Arriving at Addis Ababa its was a long wait till my flight for Hong Kong, the transit area was really bad no place to rest and food court was really terrible. Next flight on a Boeing 767, the seats were really cramped and the  entertainment system was awful, food service was so bad. They lost my luggage and apparently I was not the only one.

1.0,N Thomas,South Africa,2016-09-18,flight was delayed over four hours,"In short, my flight was delayed over four hours due to mechanical problems, including with the plane's landing gear. The service from all members of staff we encountered was dismal. My flight was scheduled to depart Addis Ababa at 12.50am and arrive in Vienna at 5.50am. At Addis Ababa, we were directed to one entrance for security screening, whereupon staff closed the doors in our faces and directed us to a second entrance, the second entrance directed us back to the first entrance, we were then directed to a third entrance, where we waited a while, until being redirected to a fourth entrance. After boarding, we sat in the plane for forty five minutes before being told that the landing gear was broken. After another half an hour we were told that the air conditioning was also broken. The heat was sweltering. After a full hour and forty five minutes of this heat, the air stewardesses thought to bring us water. A stewardess handed the last cup to the passenger beside me, looked at me, then returned to the back of the plane. I pressed the call button three times over fifteen minutes. There were several other passengers also using their call buttons. Because I was sitting at the very back of the plane, I could hear the stewardesses chatting and laughing behind me. Finally I got out of my seat, walked past the stewardesses sitting around doing nothing, and poured myself a cup of water. In the end, the flight departed over four hours late, meaning that I missed connecting flights from Vienna to London and London to Montreal. In total I was in transit for 50 hours, rather than 38. I spoke to the airline's representative company, Celebi, in Vienna airport. Celebi provided me with accommodation and meals, but told me to call Ethiopian Airlines on the subject of further compensation. I called Ethiopian Airlines, and was told to talk to Austrian Airlines. I spoke to Austrian Airlines, who informed me that because the flight was operated by Ethiopian Airlines, I must speak to Ethiopian Airlines. I called Ethiopian Airlines again and it was confirmed to me that this was correct, but that I must contact Ethiopian Airlines via email. I did so and have been waiting almost a month for a reply.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ADD to VIE,2016-08-01,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,no
1.0,F Yorath,South Africa,2016-09-04,experience is horrible,"Cotonou to Nairobi via Addis Ababa. The Ethiopian Airlines experience is horrible from one end to the other. ✅ Verified Review | Chaotic boarding in Cotonou, plane 45 minutes late with no apologies from the crew. No earphones distributed at any point for the entertainment system and not even an inflight magazine. Do not let Ethiopian’s ads on their new fleet fool you - planes (737s with Sky Interior in this case) are not properly looked after. On the Cotonou-Addis flight, there was fruit jam on the tablet and chewing-gum in the seat pocket. The seat covers were worn and falling apart. The overhead screens were not working and kept coming up and down. Very slow service with disgusting food and it took the crew about an hour and a half to clear the trays. Addis Ababa airport is a horrific place. Overcrowded, dirty, smelly (especially since the smoking areas do not close hence people smoke outside). The shops are a disgrace, with no fixed prices and people haggling over the price of items. Most items are just lying on the floor or on broken shelves, still in their delivery packages. Credit card payments did not work in two duty free shops out of three. The Ethiopian/Star Alliance Gold lounge is dark, dirty and has a very limited food choice. When I entered nobody was at the reception to scan my boarding pass. It is usually impossible to find a seat available in the evening. Better to stay outside and sit on the floor. The toilets, both in the lounge and outside, are dirty and smelly. Ethiopian Airlines ground staff are impolite, permanently yells at passengers to rush them to the gates and does not answer questions when asked something. Be careful as flights are not announced or the general chaos can lead one to miss the boarding announcements and therefore, the flight. Addis-Nairobi was similarly terrible, with tired seats (despite the young age of the aircraft, another 737 with Sky Interior). It was once again 45 minutes late with no apologies whatsoever. No earphones or inflight magazine, once again. No pre-take off checks, most people had their seatback down and/or were using laptops and electronic devices. Food very bad, with crew throwing the tray on the tablets saying “chicken” and again, the overhead screens were dysfunctional. I should also mention that at no point in Cotonou or Addis were there separate queues for Business/Gold members and Economy passengers during boarding, with disorganised queues, staff yelling in every direction and in general, a sense of squalor. It is a real pity to be sometimes forced to use Ethiopian Airlines because of the lack of competition in African skies.

1.0,E Stanner,South Africa,2016-08-29,I didn't expect such poor service,"✅ Verified Review |  Harare to London Heathrow via Addis Ababa. Appalling to say the least. Ethiopian may have new aircraft but don't let this fool you. On the HRE-ADD sector I had to tell the cabin crew to issue an infant seat belt to someone travelling with an infant seated adjacent to me, this being after two cabin crew walked through to secure the cabin. The senior crew member left the trolley unattended in the middle of the cabin during the flight to help a colleague for a good 5 minutes. The crew had zero personality, and even asked 'what does she want' to a pax sat next to the pax the crew member was referring to. They did not offer a choice of meal and instead just said 'chicken' and dumped the tray on my table. I requested fish, she returned with a meal that had fish written on the lid but was actually vegetarian inside. There was no apology, just no personality with any of the crew on all four sectors. Credit where due, one meal was edible, the rest were cold and under cooked on all sectors. Out of all four sectors, I was only able to check in and choose my seat on one. Addis Ababa airport is dismal. They are seemingly meant to be upgrading the airport. I tried to buy a sandwich with my card but couldn't because the system was down. Security is horrendous. I am all for safe flying given the current times but you will need to allow at least an hour to pass through security as they then do a passport check - and don't take any duty free liquids as these are confiscated. I was reluctant to travel with Ethiopian Airlines  more on a safety level but had minimal choice as Emirates was full.

1.0,B Andersson,South Africa,2016-08-26,Ethiopian was a huge disappointment,"✅ Verified Review |  Flying with Ethiopian was a huge disappointment. The aircraft from Addis to Stockholm was a new Boeing 787, but the entertainment system was down during the entire flight. Our departure from Addis was delayed by one hour as the ground crew tried to fix the system, but without success. The cabin crew were arrogant and inattentive. They simply did not respond to calls. At one time I could see 18 unanswered calls in business class only. I had to physically stop the cabin attendants to get their attention. They apologized to me but left all the other calls unattended. The food was tasteless and boring. For breakfast we got a terrible lukewarm Pizza. We had ordered kids meals for our children, but the cabin attendants did not know this so we had to tell them to bring the right meals. Eventually we just found out that the kids meals hardly differ from the adult meals. A major drawback of Ethiopian is that many connections mean changing flights in Addis Ababa. The airport is dirty (especially the toilets) and totally overcrowded. Passengers are only allowed to enter the waiting areas 90 minutes prior to the flights. Until then they have to wait in the general terminal and sit on the floor just to see all the empty chairs in the closed waiting area. Also the restaurant are owercrowded, overpriced and have unpolite staff. I will avoid Ethiopian in the future.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,JNB to ARN via ADD,2016-08-01,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

10.0,M Murphy,South Africa,2016-07-15,knows how to look after their customers,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew with Ethiopian Airlines (Los Angeles to Dublin return) in October 2015 and June 2016 and all 4 flights were excellent. I must say that every single member of staff I encountered from reservations, check-in, boarding, inflight and disembarking were very welcoming, helpful and friendly and all seemed to be 'happy' in their jobs which I find rare in the airline industry in this day and age. The plane was very spacious and legroom is the best I have experienced on transatlantic flights. I found the food very good with a great choice of meals offered and being able to have a 'free' wine (or two) with dinner a nice touch. In October 2015 Ethiopian Airlines was the only airline offering direct flights from Los Angeles to Dublin and although Aer Lingus started operating a direct flight in May 2016, I found that ticket prices for Ethiopian Airlines were almost half the price of Aer Lingus flights for the dates I was looking for. Also on the return flight from Dublin to Los Angeles in October 2015 that although we were told on check-in that there was going to be up to an eight hour delay in departing, all customers were looked after very quickly and very efficiently by friendly staff and within half an hour, we were being taken to a nearby 4* Hotel, treated to full breakfast and lunch in the hotel before being picked up and brought back late afternoon for departure - that to me is proof that Ethiopian Airlines knows how to look after their customers.

No inflight entertainment for 5.5 hours (except for music via broken head sets).

Cracked tray table, broken seat pocket.

This was my first time flying with this particular Star Alliance member, Ethiopian Airlines, through our Aeroplan points. It started off great. The staff are super friendly and helpful and throughout the whole thing the flight attendants in particular were amazing. The good started and ended there. After electrical malfunctioning of the plane we waited on board for 4.5 hrs before being told to disembark due to the difficulties the plane was having. Then we were told a new flight would be scheduled for us in the morning. The catch? No hotels could be provided due to no availability. They provided camping mats and thin blankets for us to sleep on the floor of the terminal. We missed all our connecting flights and needed a way to get to BFN in time to attend a meeting. Trying to get information out of anyone in order to get our bags and cancel our tickets was impossible even with the help of the Heathrow Information people (who were extremely nice, and tried to be helpful as possible), and other airport staff getting involved. While waiting for the luggage we requested back we watched the poor staff try and maintain order to a very angry group of people storming the gate.

Check-in was swift as was the passport check at Addis airport. I was flying with a *A Gold Card holder and so was able to use the ‘Cloud Nine’ lounge at Addis. This lounge falls far below the standard I would expect of a premium lounge. It was overcrowded, dark and unwelcoming. On board the aircraft we were offered a hot meal. It was very basic airline fare – chicken and rice, a very hard bread role and some sort of sweet offering (which to be honest I have forgotten about). The seats were old and in disrepair. The fabric looked tired and scruffy. Toilets became more and more filthy during this short flight – I did not see the flight attendants check them once (I was in the back row). I am sorry to say that once again, I was not impressed. Landed at NBO and immigration was via the new makeshift terminal.

It took me 1 hour 40 minutes to get a boarding pass from the Check-in counter and there were people jumping the queues as the staff was least bothered to organise the long queues. There was a delay of 3 hours in departure which resulted in missing the connecting flights for onward journey. The local Ethiopian Airline staff at Addis Ababa had no clue of the late arriving transfer passengers (inspite of boarding passes issued at Mumbai). They were so arrogant and insensitive that after a 1.40 hour check in + 3 hour delay + 5 hour flying time, we were all made to stand at the transfer desk without water or seating. There was only 1 staff who was cancelling and re-issuing new boarding passes for next available flight which took 2 hours. When the passengers got angry, they offered food coupons which can be redeemed only for Chicken gravy, Dry vegetables and rice along with bread and a bottle of water. The vegetarians had to eat plain Rice with Dry vegetables (no curry). No Tea or Coffee was available. The connecting flights were from 5 to 7 hours later.

Boarded at around 11.30pm in LAX, didn't take off until nearly 2am (I had heard they were often late, which seems to be true on so many occasions - looked at a popular flight tracking website and most if not all their past flights were 1-2 hours or more late). When we finally left LAX, the cabin crew started at the back of economy delivering meals. They reached my seat (front of last economy section) at around 3am. I was handed the tray with ""here's chicken"", the crew couldn't have been less bothered, no smiles (except from purser when we stepped aboard) and a general look of being completely fed up. The ""meal"" (using that term very loosely) was absolutely the worst I have eaten on board an aircraft. The tray, food containers and servings were tiny. Rock hard bread bun and a slimy square of something resembling a muffin/desert bread. Measly pieces of chicken in a runny gravy with two tiny boiled potatoes and a piece of broccoli. The crew took so long to collect trays that people started to leave them on the floor by the bulk-head / door. At around 4.30am they were picked up and lights were left on full brightness in the cabin until maybe 5am. My armrest TV was broken as were maybe half of the TV screens in the cabin (this was a relatively new B787-8 aircraft). Toilets were in poor shape for most of the flight. When we arrived in Dublin, we waited at the carousel for bags to be delivered for close to an hour and a half. Tweeted Dublin Airport Authority to ask what was going on and they replied that it was the airline's fault. Reading another review on here, I feel lucky that we got our bags at all. Return flight to LAX two weeks later was better because the flight was maybe a third full and entertainment system was working. However, Food was still pathetic and we left Dublin an hour late.

Ethiopian managed to cancel two of my four flights, resulting in rebooking and losing a day's holiday accommodation (having to return a day earlier) and changed the Boeing 787 to a first generation Boeing 777. I would acknowledge that my family were allowed to go with me (Star Alliance Gold) in the Sheba lounge. Food okay, smiles of staff super, but it was very overcrowded. During all the changes to our flights, I was offered accommodation for my family and tours in Addis (we would have had to spend one unplanned night in Addis).

1.0,L Callanan,South Africa,2016-04-21,quality is not up there,"I flew with the carrier for the first time in March 2016, from Dublin to Los Angeles. I am a frequent flyer, and have at some stage used most of the main international carriers, and this is the first time I have ever felt the need to go to the trouble of writing a poor review for an airline. The outbound flight was rescheduled at the last minute, meaning I arrived just over an hour late to LAX. Subsequently I missed the connecting flight which was Alaska Airlines. They told us to contact Ethiopian, who should have checked us in all the way to our final destination at Dublin airport but had refused to do so. We spent an our on the phone to Ethiopian customer services, as they had no representation at all at LAX. The person dealing with us on the phone was incredibly rude. Eventually he agreed that Ethiopian would pay for and book us on another flight, we were instructed to go back to Alaska Airlines. When we discussed what we were told with them, they said the method suggested was impossible. Luckily Alaska airline were extremely helpful and gave us change of seat fare instead of full fare, on the next flight available, which was actually from Orange County airport the next day, which cost us shuttle bus and hotel. As for the flights themselves, our screens did not work in either outbound or return flight and the crew seemed to think this was normal on a 10 hour flight. I had to clean the toilet on my flight home to use it, as every toilet on the aircraft after 4 hours into the flight was dirty. I am the least fussy eater but I can say the food was not even recognisable for some meals, I suggest bringing your own snacks. Finally the most concerning point, when waiting to leave LA, there was some kind of technical trouble, so we sat on the aircraft for two hours before leaving, late again of course. The problem was, before leaving we received no safety demo. None of the crew came around to inspect the cabin configuration for take off, my friend was fast asleep with her seat reclined as we started to head down runway. Ethiopian Airlines is the first airline I have ruled out so far. The flights were more expensive than other carriers but the quality is not up there with the big carriers I'm afraid.

My Ethiopian Airlines flight from London to Johannesburg via Addis Ababa was one to remember.

I am gluten intolerant and I booked a special meal when I bought the flight, but they don't know what gluten intolerance means. I found on my tray written GF (gluten free) but they gave me bread and muffins (containing gluten) saying that this was what they had. Luckily I brought with me something to eat in case.

Both flights were operated with a Boeing 777-300, and the aircraft was a lot more comfortable then Emirates. Ethiopian have a 3x3x3 seat layout whereas Emirates is 3x4x3. The aircraft was spacious, seats were very comfortable and seat pitch great. The food on both flights was above what I expected on  and the crew were fantastic. I found them nicer than European airlines I have flown. I will definitely fly them again, but a word of warning. Addis Ababa Bole airport really needs an overhaul and some of the ground staff could do with going on a customer service course. It was a shame that this is what seems to have let Ethiopian Airlines down in the past and still does.

At LAX check-in the agent was very informative and helpful. I thought may be the crew members on board would be the same, but unfortunately I was wrong. The crew were not friendly at all, and there was no warm and welcoming feel to it. They're just there to do their job and get it out of the way. They bump into my seat while pushing the cart and into my elbow few times, I didn't hear any word from them. Not a sorry, excuse me or pardon me or anything.

Problems started in Addis. The flight from Addis to Dar was delayed every 30 min due to operational reasons, from 10PM local time until midnight, when they took our boarding passes to issue us hotel vouchers. We were taken to a lounge and given some rice and curry chicken. At 2AM we still had no information, and no boarding passes. After harassing the staff, we were told that ""due to the weather"", we would have to spend the night in Addis and leave at 10AM. We had to wait for hotel vouchers, which were given to us at 4AM. Total waiting time from the scheduled departure time to getting hotel vouchers was 5 hours! The next day, the 10AM flight was delayed by 1 hour for operational reasons. Good side: we were taken to a nice hotel with clean rooms and bathroom (no hot water in bathrooms with a 12°C temperature outside), and were served breakfast before being taken to the airport at 8AM.

Food and drinks were served on all sectors, not inspiring but adequate. In flight entertainment was good - excellent on the 787 - the PA announcements were clear and repeated in 5 languages - and the flight deck kept passengers well informed. Overall we were impressed and would fly that route with Ethiopian again, and recommend it to others, for which it repesented excellent value. Although we had a 7hr lay-over at ADD on the return, the airport unusually has comfortable beds in the transit area to lie on and reasonably priced freshly cooked refreshments (even at 01.00hrs) and drinks in various cafes. It was certainly more comfortable than the lay-over at Dubai airport last year. Warning: - do not buy any form of liquids - water, alcohol, or perfumes at the Addis Ababa duty free.

5.0,Adrian Kennedy,South Africa,2016-03-04,price fantastic for us,"Ethiopian Airlines price was fantastic for us as pensioners, £320 return from Dublin to Johannesburg, so we were willing to put up with a little discomfort, but were impressed with most things. Addis Ababa is not the world's idea of a great airport and the ground staff there were most unhelpful and far from organised. It was only a 2hr 25m stopover, as we waited for our connecting flight to Dublin. The announcement, over an antiquated address system, was called as a Canadian flight and via Dublin was never mentioned, caught it by the skin of our teeth. Ground staff at Johannesburg were great and could not have been more helpful. We had 3 seats each from Johannesburg to Addis to relax on for the 4.5hr flight, food acceptable and no worse than other airlines. The planes look well used and a lot of the seat screens did not work. Cabin crew vary from inexperienced to most helpful and just the luck of the draw.

Food remains of poor and quality and serving a warm lunch at 11 am and or 1 am is a strange way of trying to cut expenses, a light breakfast or snack would be far better. Ethiopian has reduced the miles you receive as status miles when flying with them - this of course depends what bookuing class you have reserved your ticket.

1.0,H Spaling,South Africa,2016-02-18,last time flying them,"I flew for the first time on Ethiopian Airlines from London Heathrow to Addis Ababa to Harare in Feb 2016. Unbelievable screw ups! My luggage didn’t arrive and was held in Addis (despite an 8 hr layover!). It came 2 days later even though there are daily flights to Harare. Worse yet, ET completely cancelled my return sector from Harare to Addis (ET 873) without any notice (my email is in the booking file). I only found out by coincidence on checking my booking online. As it was a Sunday and the main city office was closed, I went to the airport to reinstate this sector. Nothing could be done. Go the city office tomorrow, I was told. So, I did and ET office staff first told me my scheduled flight (ET 873) was cancelled. They asked if I could travel a day earlier (and wait 24 hr in Addis for my connecting flight to London-Heathrow). Then, I was told ET 873 wasn’t cancelled after all, and I was given a print-out confirming my flight and a seat on ET 873. Then, trying to check in online, I read a note on my file that there was still a problem with the Harare-Addis sector and I should see the counter check in agent. At airport check-in, I’m told the ET office printout showed a booking in V class but their computer shows U class. (How is that even possible on a single booking?) Even though my original itinerary showed U class, and U is higher than V class, they would not check me in. I waited 45+ minutes for the office and airport staff to correct their problem before being issued a boarding pass. It doesn’t end there. On arrival in London Heathrow (ET 700), I noticed that my previously confirmed aisle seat is now a window seat on my Air Canada (AC 851) flight to Calgary. How can ET even change a confirmed seat on AC when AC couldn’t assign a seat for me on ET prior to my departure?  Ethiopian Airlines don’t belong in the Star Alliance.

Secondly the airport connection in Addis is very chaotic without any notification from the airport staff, passengers have to figure their own way out. The seats on the 787 are comfortable enough but if the airline does not take care, in a few months the electronics may fall apart.

A fair number of unruly and loud children on the flight, but that seems to be a standard on long-haul flights to Africa. Addis to Entebbe was good, including a full meal on a 2 hours flight.

Seat leg room is shorter than normal, I'd say 30-31 inches at best. Seats are uncomfortable, the cushions are not well attached and will slide around so you are almost sitting on the seat frame. In flight entertainment consisted of 5 or 6 movies playing on a loop, the screens are very small and picture quality is not good, sound is distorted. Food was poor. Flight attendants spent most of the time in the back and did not walk through with beverages after the normal meal service and did not respond to call button. On all landings (4 on this trip) people started getting up as soon as the wheels touched the ground and the flight attendants sat and watched without saying a thing. Manila to Bangkok the flight was almost empty, but Bangkok to Addis was very full. This airline owns 5 or 6 Boeing 787s which they use for shorter, lower traffic flights within Africa.

The meal was tasty. Plane arrived 20 minutes early in KUL. Flight in Economy was very cheap compared to Thai or Malaysia Airlines. Captain gave some flight information, nothing special to remember. All in all Ethiopian Airlines is for an african carrier very good, in their modern aircraft it must be a nice experience. I flew Ethiopian Airlines several times now, and never credited my mileage automatically - for frequent flyers not ideal, and you must credit the miles manually by contacting the costumer service of the airline - Ethiopian Airlines should improve that, it should be possible for a Star Alliance Carrier.",Business,Economy Class,BKK to KUL,2015-10-01,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5,yes

There were never any announcements that boarding had started and the screen just showed departure time, but no ""boarding"". The lounge agent called the gate and she was informed that they were doing last call. Onboard, the aircraft which is only 2 years old, showed its wear and tear. Ripped seat pockets, broken cup holders. Entertainment screen was not responsive. Service was ok. Flight attendants did their job, but no smiles. 2 hot meals served, but no choices. No snacks provided. Meals tasted ok, but looked more like a TV dinner. Return flight from Dublin a little better. Granted the 6am departure is a killer. Again, no mention of lounge access. When asked, we were informed that it was only for Business Class customers. Only after checking with another agent, we were given lounge invitations. Return leg, friendlier crew. Better meals with an option of chicken or ravioli and a hot breakfast, prior to arrival. This plane was in better shape.

In addition the outlet for the headphones was not connecting properly so sounds was far from clear. Then the choice to play a subtitled Chinese movie was also an odd choice and hardly a new release, if one was able to see or hear the movie. As I went to charge my iphone was told that the power outlet at the seat was not working, then apparently there was not power at any seat. Food was unappetising.

I especially enjoyed the selection of Ethiopian dishes on offer, and the cabin crew were very encouraging in getting us to try them. IFE was virtually non-existent on one of the B767, and poor on the other flights, but this would be my only major complaint.

How can they think of operating a Boeing 737 to Mumbai for a 5 hour flight? Completely cramped flight, no option to even move your hand, forget reclining the seats. Veg Meal was the worse that I have had with any airline. Only plus sign was again they served drinks as often as we wanted. Veg food was an insult, sweet rice and sweet chick pea curry.

My partner and her son travelled from London Heathrow to Ndola in Zambia via Addis Ababa. The check in at London was excellent and the girl on the check-in could not have been more helpful. Once we boarded the flight, things went downhill fast, the cabin crew were not very helpful at all, meals were more or less thrown at you, not served. The food was terrible, the aircon onboard was very poor. During the flight, a guy collapsed while walking about and if it was not for my partner and 2 medical students tending to him, I dont like to think what the outcome would have been, the cabin crew were more concerned with chatting to each other and the medical kit onboard was a joke. The seats were hard and passenger comforts seem to have been forgotten about. After our connection in Addis Ababa you would think it was a different airline, the crew and comforts were first class and we couldn't understand why there was such a huge difference.

1.0,Roland Poole,India,2015-11-12,care for luggage is non existent,"I'm a frequent traveler between Bangkok and Cape Town (at least six times per year) and on my last trip (November 2015) I decided to use Ethiopian Airlines because their price was very competitive and it's an African airline, and I always try to support an African enterprise. This time my journey proved to be a mistake and, proved that you get what you pay for. Firstly, the planes were small and cramped - but I suppose this contributes to the low airfare. The departure lounges at Addis Ababa airport were shocking. Most of the info TVs were not working or showing other things apart from flight and departure info. The toilets were horrendous - wet floors, smelly, locks on doors broken, extremely aggressive staff, etc Thirdly and most importantly, Ethiopian Airlines does not take responsibility for your luggage. I had bought a Panasonic LED TV which I took back to Cape Town. At check in I asked for them to put on a Fragile sticker. I was told to take it to Oversize luggage and that they will put on the sticker. This I did and again I asked to for the sticker to be put on. They said they would. When changing planes at Addis Ababa my new seat was above the cargo hold of the plane and I saw them loading on my TV, without any sticker! I wasn't too concerned, as I thought they could quite easily see that it's a TV and would be careful. when I got home in Cape Town, I unpacked the TV only to find the screen had been cracked. I immediately phoned the Ethiopian Airlines call center and was told that I should send an email to Customer Relations explaining the problem. This I did, and I received an automated reply saying that they would get back to me within 10 working days - what a shocking time standard for an international company. After 12 working days I sent them a follow up email, and got a reply to say that the South African office will get in touch with me. On my return trip to Bangkok, I had still not heard from the South African office, so while I was at Cape Town International airport I tried to follow up on the matter only to be given the email address of the man in charge. Thirteen days later I had still not heard from the South African office, so again I sent an email. This time I got a rather prompt reply saying that they could not consider the claim because Ethiopian Airlines should not have accepted the TV when I checked in at Bangkok Airport, and  I took too long to report the incident - even though all my correspondence (from day one) with them was attached to all emails. I'm sure I don't even need to highlight the stupidity of this kind of reasoning. Their lack of accountability and pathetic customer service leaves me more disappointed than angry. I certainly would not say don't use them. If budget is important then they're the best option, however bear in mind they you'll be dealing with a company where customer service is at an all time low and concern and care for your luggage is non existent.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Cape Town,2015-10-01,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,no

I have mixed feelings about my flights: on the first trip, Boeing 787 airplane already looked ageing althought it cannot be old, FAs were robotic and didn't smile, food from CDG was bad and the breakfast was almost nothing (two biscuits). Return trip was better, with smiley and nice FAs on both flights, sligthly better food and better looking cabins. On the good side, seats were less cramped that I feared (and I'm tall), travel time CDG-JNB is convenient and of course price is competitive. The IFE is convenient but the choice of films and languages is limited, wine was awful and choice of alcool very limited. The FAs were sometimes rude and/or robotic.

New fleet, cheerful and helpful flight attendants. This is a complete contrast to their flights into and out of the continent. Planes were very old with no inflight entertainment whatsoever.  I could never get over the fact that the flight attendants are rude and unwilling to help. I'm not talking about them not smiling (I understand some cultures don't really smile). When several fellow passengers were asking for water or drinks they were ignored. One passenger was trying to call one of them, and he was ignored. When I asked if the flight was full and if it was possible for me to change seats (I was seated next to a very obnoxious passenger), the flight attendant just said ""if you can find an empty seat go ahead."" Besides that, it takes them way too long to serve food and get the food trays after eating. Some passengers put their trays on the floor creating a mess and it took them too long to clean it, even though they could clearly see the mess those passengers were making. And there are only three toilets in the economy class for almost 200 people. There was a queue to the lavatories the whole time. I booked my flight because they offered the fastest route to my destinations in Africa, but I've discovered it's not worth it. They're not even that much cheaper compared to other airlines!

Why not give everyone a bottle as most airlines do on over night flights? The lights were turned off/on and on/off so many times, and it was hard to get sleep when they're doing this frequently.

When I got to the gate, I was shocked to meet a very hostile Ethiopian Airlines staff there who said I was now over my baggage allowance and I was told that I had to pay for excess luggage or miss my flight. He was very rude when I tried to explain myself to him. I had never experienced anything like that with any other airline before. What you buy at duty free shops airside shouldn't count as excess luggage, especially when it's not excessive. Otherwise why are the shops there? I had the receipts as proof that the items were bought there at the airport but he didn't want to hear anything I had to say. He shouted at me everytime I tried to explain. So I had no choice but to pay. Is this right for airlines to make passengers pay for excess baggage for duty free goods bought at the airport?

1.0,A Goodwright,India,2015-10-01,never been treated so badly,"I've just returned from a trip using Ethiopian Airlines. On the outbound journey they bumped us off one flight, bumped us off another then re routed us via Entebbe causing us to miss a whole day of activities whilst on tour in Rwanda. When we arrived it was to major disappointment our luggage didn't. The airline staff had no idea where our bags were and it took 2 days to locate them (one member ensuring us they were in Addis and would be arriving on the next flight, 6 flights arrived and still no luggage and one telling us they got takn off in Entebbe as there was no room on the plane due to other cargo). This ruined the start of our holiday as well as missing out on activities that we had pre paid for! The return leg was nothing more than a farce and absolute disgrace to the aviation industry! We were due to depart Kigali at 3.30 on Sep 29th, they hoarded the passengers to the gate where we were kept for over 4 hours as the screen kept displaying delay messages, no staff were present to request assistance from, nor was there access to any bathroom or water, we were hot and tired along with many other passengers. Eventually, around 6pm, we found out the flight was cancelled due to a cracked windscreen. This is not the ideal information to receive. Instead of handling the situation, their ground staff manager in Kigali airport was a disgrace and had no customer service skills. We were given no information and when asking for information or whether we could be rebooked she continued to shout at all the tired and upset passengers and treat us like dogs. We were herded round the back of the airport to collect our own bags and told to leave if we want - to go where?? Having arrived at the airport at 1.30pm and after a long tiring day we eventually were rebooked by 10.30pm, it took 9 hours and we were offered nothing! Not even a spoken apology came from the ground staff! We were rebooked at 2.30am on September 30th and had nowhere to go. We then had to go via Addis and Dubai and had approx another 24 hours of travelling till we'd reach our final destination. This meant taking extra days of vacation as we arrived back a day late. We were offered nothing by means of an apology, food or water just abuse by the Ethiopian Airlines ground staff. I've never been treated so badly in my life, my holiday was ruined due to their inability to provide the service I paid for and it was apparant they do not care about their passengers just making money by redirecting flights to collect more people (money) and refusing to rebook us with alternate airlines when cancelling our flight. I am appalled a so called customer service orientated company can treat human beings like this, yet alone paying customers!

We had one receptive flight attendant the whole time. She was delightful and did her best at trying to locate our pre-ordered meals. The other flight attendants seemed exhausted, by the end of the trip they just hit the back of a passengers chair if it was in full recline and would say ""move it up"" it just became comical. The inflight entertainment was scarce, the flight tracker was never reset as it stated we were departing from Addis Ababa not Dublin. By the time we landed in LAX there was no ""thank you for flying with us"" just ""bye"" as all the passengerd exited. One of my children had left a bag with toys under the seat in front of her.

Overall a pleasant flight. Addis Ababa airport was chaotic. A lot of people sitting around in corridors with mountains of hand luggage. The Ethiopian lounge was busy but I was able to get a seat. The seats looked good but were distinctly uncomfortable. No facilities for lying down or sleeping. Food and beverages were OK but not great. No showers and toilets not great. Wifi was available but very patchy in coverage and speed - staff were obviously aware of this as they warned me when I asked for the password. I was looking forward to the flight ADD-LHR as it was on one of Ethiopian's fairly new 787s. Boarding was fine. Business class layout was 2-2-2 but as there were few passengers, I could have an empty seats beside me. The seats were very disappointing and appeared to be an old design. They reclined to a relatively flat bed but it was angled and lumpy - not good for sleeping. Why Ethiopian would buy modern aircraft and fit them with inferior seats in their most profitable cabin is impossible to understand. Food was not good. I had beef which was tough and poorly seasoned. Other parts of the meal were similarly disappointing. In the business class cabin, there were 3 crew. One was dressed in a colourful uniform and was both pleasant and efficient. The other two were in drab outfits and had personalities to match. IFE worked OK but had a limited selection. The flight arrived on time. On arrival at LHR, my checked bag was not there.
