## Overview
This project is designed to explore the forage job market using data science techniques. The data will be extracted from a public website, transformed into a suitable format, and analyzed using various tools and techniques.

## Stage 1: Data Engineering
### Objective
In the first stage, we'll focus on Extracting, Transforming, and Loading (ETL) forage job data from the ABC website using Python's Beautiful Soup library for web scraping.

### Tasks
- Web scraping: Use Python's Beautiful Soup library to extract data from the ABC website.
- Data transformation: Transform the data into a tabular format.
- Data loading: Load the transformed data into a Microsoft SQL Server database, specifically the AAA table.
- Data cleaning: Clean and structure the data in the AAA table.
- Data normalization: Normalize the AAA table.

## Stage 2: Data Analytics
### Objective
In the second stage, we'll use data analytics techniques to gain insights from our data.

### Tasks
- Data visualization: Use Power BI to create visualizations of the data.
- Data analysis: Use Python to explore and analyze the data.

## Stage 3: Data Science
### Objective
Finally, in the third stage, we'll apply machine learning (ML) predictive models and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the data and make predictions.

### Tasks
- Model development: Develop ML predictive models using Python.
- NLP analysis: Perform NLP analysis to extract insights from text data.

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Beautiful Soup library
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Power BI
- Python libraries (pandas, NumPy, etc.)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: 
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Start working on the project: `python main.py`
